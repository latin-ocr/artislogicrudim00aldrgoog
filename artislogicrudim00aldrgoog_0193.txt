There is also 110 11611661 16 Α11610116 101 limiting the
means by whichNominal Definition may be effeoted3
as is done by those Logicians who specify synonyms
and etymologias. The latter indeed seems 10 have
trespassed on the domuin 01 Logic 110111 11161 011111610110.
Nor has it the slightest connection with the former, 6616
by an ambiguity 0116636636. The etymology will in

the word, but either one 111611166 11600166 obsolete, 01
some secundary 601106, which may account 101 the
imposition 011116 name, but which 6160 11616 formed,
strictly speaking, any part 01 116 signification. This holds
equally of real objects and imaginary. It is only by an
equivocatiou that “bull-piercer'' can be assigned 66 the
