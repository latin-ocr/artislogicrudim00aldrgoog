⁵ '‘Rci, i. e. of an universal notion existing in the mind; with-
out entering on the question whether there exists any external
universal nature corresponding to it. Since all such notions
are represented by words, a real, or more correctly speaking
a curtenai, definition, will at the same time unfold the meaning
of the word by which tho given notion is represented. Still

Α the two kinds of definition must not be confounded. Areal

definition has primarily forits object to analyse a complex
notion into its component parts. Words are employed
recordantia though unavoidably, as signs both of the whole
notion, and of the simpler notions of which it is composed.
But the object of nominal definition is to determine of what
notion, simple or complex, a given word is the sign. The
notion may be already known, more or less clearly, by means
of other signs, though'we were not aware of its connexion
with the word in question.

If this account of real definition is correct, it will follow
that the same notion admits of only one definition; or
at least, that the varieties are only such as may be produced
by a more or less minuto analysis or by an occidental
difference in tho manner of expressiug the same notion.
And nothing can be more clear than Aristotle’s testimony on
these points, nothing more positive than his repudiation of
the socalled ceadwal and physicol definitions. (of. Top. vi.
