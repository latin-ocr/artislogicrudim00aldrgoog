I. AttributeS, under which term are included all things
belonging to any other Oategory than that of substance.
These exist only in Substances as their subjecta and their
existence is properly determined by Demonstratiooc.
When ascertained in any other way, we are said to
know it only accidentally d. In the Demonstrative syl-
logism, the minor term is the Subjeot, the major the
Attribute ; the Cause, by virtue of which the Subject is
thus affected, being the middle term. When by such a
Syllogism we have proved that all A is B, we know that
the attribute B exists in the subject A.

ΙΙ. Substances, which exist not in a subject, but per
set Of such the existence cannot be proved, but must
be assumed, before any of their Attn'butes can be demon-
strated. This assumption, under the name of HypothesiS,
forms one of the Aristotelian ἀρχαί, or Principles of
Science, which must precede all Demonstration‘.

special sense to such Attributes as exist only contingently, end ors therefore
indemonstrable.
