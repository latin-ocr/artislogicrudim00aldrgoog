authority, we may fairly assert that Logic as a formal
Science can take no cognisance of the following points.

Ι. It has nothing to do with determining the physical
existence of attributes in their subjects3 which isin fact
an inqniry into the nsoterinl truta of the propositions in
’ which such attributes are predicated. It is true that such
propositions are by Aristotle considered as the conclusions
of Syllogism, and so far their truth is merely formal. But
it must be remembered‚ that no attribute can be syllogis-
tically demonstrated of one subject, without being in the
premise asserted of another; and it is upon the material
truth of the latter proposition that the certainty of the
former, and the demonstrative character of the whole
reasoning, ultimately depends.

II. Logic has nothing to do with testing the material
correctness of a definition‚ i. e. ascertaining how far the
notions developed in our analysis of a conception cor-
respond to the principal phenomena exhibited by the

objects usually included under that concepti0n3 nor even
with the inqniry, whether our usage of terms corresponds

with the ordinary language of others

Still less does it lie within the province of Logic to
perform the functione either of a Dictionary or of an
Index to Physical Science 3 to convey‚ thetis, information
from without, whether conceming the meaning of words
or the nature of things, into a mind previously ignorant.
, Whereas from the statements of some Logicians, one
might almost imagine that they regarded their Science
as furnishing, as it were, Logarithmic Tables of things in
general; Catalogues of Genera and Differentiae, to which
we have only to refer any given object, to obtain full
information conceming it¹¹.
