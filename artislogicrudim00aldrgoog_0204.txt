the proof may be given in Categorioal Syllogisms In
others, it is far more naturally exhibited in the hypo·
thetical form. The assumption of a hypothetioal premise

not always in the most natural, form; and it is frequently
the only materially allowable assumption in oases where
the given antecedent and consequent have both terms
distinet. E. g. A is B, therefore Gis D. We may
supply, If A is B, O is D; but to determine the truth of
the assumed proposition, whether it be hypothetioal or
oategorioal, does not fall within the provinoe of the
Logioian.

Among these material, and therefore extra-logical,
Consequenoes, are to be olassed those whioh Reid
adduoes as oases for which Logio does not provide5
e. g. “Alexander was the son of Philip,” therefore
“Philip was the father of Alexander ;'' “A is greater
than B,” therefore “B is less than A.” In both these it
is our material knowledge of the relations “father and
son,’' “greater and lesS,'’ that enables us to make the
inferenoe. ’

Another of Reid's examples is the following: “A is
equal to B, and B is equal to C, therefore A is equal
to 02³ This reasoning is elliptioal, and therefore, us a
stands, material ; though owing to the suppressed premise
being sels-evident, its defioienoy is apt to be overlooked.
Stated in logioal form, the syllogism runs thus: ⁴

Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other;
A and C are equal to the same,
Therefore A and C are equal to eaeh other⁸.

Another example of the same kind is that sometimes
oalled reasoning ιι fortiori. E. g. “A is greater than B,
