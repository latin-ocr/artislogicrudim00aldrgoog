become predicable of it as a differentia, property, or accident;
e. g. “ snow is white.” Predicstes thus formed from attributes
are called connotative, being said to signiiy primarily the
attribute, and to cannete or agnisy womarily the subject of
inhesion. Hence a connotative term may be defined, “One
which primarily signifies an attribute, secondarilya subject.”
Whereas the original rmiversalsr‚ whether substances or at
tributea as “man'' or “whitenesa” were called absolute.
Again‚ by an actos the mind, the terms signiiying substantes
may be conceived in the form of attributes, so as to be no
longer predicable of the individuale ; thus “homo'' becomes
“humanitas'’ All such terma, not predicable of singular
substance's, whether primarily attributes, as “ whiteness‚'' or
secondarily conceived as attributes, as “ humanity‚” are called
abstract terms; all that are predicable of the individuals,
whether primarily, as “ h0m0‚” or secondarily, as “ white‚” are
coicerete. Hence the two divisione are distinct in principle,
though some of the members of each crosa. For example:
Homo is concrete and absolute, albu concrete and couno
native, albedo abstract and absolute ; but no abstract term is
connotative.

The above account differs considerably from that given by
Mr. Mill, Logia, b. i. chap. 2. His account is more valuable in
a philosophical than in a historica] point of view. Now that a
juster view of the philosophy of language has abolished univer·
sal substanceS, Mr. Mill's extensiones connotative tems, so as
to include all concrete general names, may be regarded as an
improvement on the scholastic distinctions; but it must not
be confounded with them. The materials of the present
note are chiefly from Occam, Logia, p. i. chap. t, 10. It
must be admitted, however, that there is some lieence in the
use of the word connotative.
