The history of the word Maxim is given in alearned note
by Sir W. Hammon, Reid’s Worka p. 766. He shows that
it originated with Boethius, by whom, however, it was merely
used as an adjective, in the phrase mociano propositio. The
Schoolmen dropped the latter word, and employed ιιιααὶνιιι as
asubstantive; as had previously been done in Greek by
PselluS, from whom the whole account in Petrus Hispanus is
horrowed. Τόπος διαιρεῖται είς τόπον τὴν μεγίστην καὶ εἷς τόπον τὴν
διαφορὰν τῆς μεγίστης. Μεγίστη ἐστί πρότασις ἧς οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλη
προτέρα καί γνωριμωτέρα, ὡς τὸ πᾶν ὅλον μεῖζόν ἐστι τοῦ ἰδίου μέρους...
τόπος διαφορὰ μεγίστης ε’στιν ᾧ διαφίρει μία μεγίστη ἑτέρας.

fIn this account of certainty, Aldrich has departed con-
siderably from his first definition. “Omnis homo est risibilis*
can hardly by any stretch of language be called a moral
precept. Moral certainty is a very different thing from
demonstrative certainty, being merely a high degree ol
probability. But nothing can be more confused than the
whole of this chapter.
