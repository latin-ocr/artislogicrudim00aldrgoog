such notions alone should be admitted in a theory of
Predication. Such atheory only distinguishes the several
relations which the subject and predicate of a proposition
may bear to each other. With the objective existence of
things corresponding to our general notioris, we have for
the present no concern. Whatever theory may be
adopted as tc the origin of our ideas, there can beno ἢ
doubt that we have the power of forming combinatione
in the mind, which have not been ohserved to exist in

nature ¹⁰. And the relation of subject and predicate ’

in propositions into which such notions enter, may be
identified with some of the relations of other notions.

In constructing or explaining a theory of Predication
in conformity with these views, there isone ambiguity
which it is not possible to avoid, without a coinage of
new terma The distinctions of Genus and Differentia
must be gained by comparing two terms not predicable
of each other. Compare, for example, Man with Brute,

the common Genus will be Animal, the respective Diffe-
rentiae, Rational and IrrationaI. But there is no absolute
Genus οι· Differentia, and frequently, while the whole
comprehension of the notion remains the same, the Genus
and Differentia may change places, according as it is
compared with this or that other notion. In the oom-
parison, for example, of a plane triangle with a paral-
lelogram, “rectilineal figure'’ is its common, “having
three sides'' its distinetive pert. But compare aplane
with a spherica] triangle, “ having three sides” is common
to both; the distinction being, that the sides in the one
case are straight lines, in the other ares of great circlea
But when one only of the compared notions is employed
as the subject of a proposition, and a portion of the
attributes which it comprehends is predicated of it, that
predicate cannot properly be called Genus or Differentia,
