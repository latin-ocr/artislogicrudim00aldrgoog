eristic method of the Sophists. They employed it chiefly
to enforoe their leading dogma of the unreality of all
knowledge, speculative or practical. Accordingly, they
endeavoured, by ingenious applicatione of the dialectic
mode of reasoning, to involve those with whom they dis·
puted in sels-contradictions and absurdities3 and thus to
show that, whatever principles we start from, paradox and
inconsistency will be the invariable result.

On the other hand, the method of Socrates partook
largely of the πεοςαστοκῆ or tentative, which Aristotle
defines as ίο]1ονοε,ἡ γὰρ ueremini ἔστι διαλεκτική τις καὶ
θεωρεῖ οὐ τὸν εἰδότα ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀγνοοῦντα καὶ προσποιούμενον. The
opinion which Socrates entertained of the professions of ³
his contemporaries appears in his well-known explana-
tion of the Oracle which pronounced him the wisest of
men⁸; and the same conviction and exposure of ignorance
and protension constantly appears in the Platonic dia-

logues For this purpose he insists on the superior fitness

of his own dialectic to the longer mode of reasoning em-
ployed by some of the Sophists, and saysh that many
orators can discourse ably at length, but that if ex·
amiued by searohing questions, they are, like written

‘ bookS, unable to reply. Indead, the principal objectos

the dialogue in which this declaration occurs seems to
be to shew that the would-be toacher of virtue is ig-
norant of the nature of that which he professes to teach,
and to evinoe the superiority of the Socratio over the
sophistieal use of Dialectici

To Socrates, according to the testimony of Aristotle,
may be attributed two discoveries in Logic, Induction
