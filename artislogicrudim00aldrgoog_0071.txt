puy-ln. bc. Categorica pura, sive Propositio de iaeose',

aeneiaest quae pure affirmat vel negat3 i. e. simpliciter

necessary, the impossible, the contingent, and the possible.
(ἆναγκαῖον-ἇδύνατον-ἒνδεχόρκνον-δυνατόν.) These he afterwards,
anal. Pr. i. 2. 1. reduces to two, the necessary and the oon·
tingant. See st. Hilaire's Translation, Preface‚ p. 66. That
he adds the true and the false is questionable ; the words
ἀληθές, οὑκ ἀληθές, in de Int. 12. 10. are perhaps only intended
to mark the previous four pairs as contradictorias, of which
the one must be true the other false. Subsequent Logiciana,
following the Greek Commentators, have multipHed the
number of modes· ad infinitam. Any adverb annexed to the
predicate, “ bento canit velociter,'' or even an adjective qualilying
the subject, ‘⁴ borao albas eremit?¹ was regarded as forming a
modal. The nome τρόπον, as· applied both to the modes oi
propositions and to those of syllogisms, is not Aristotelian,
but comes from the Greek Commentators. (Ammonius Schol.
p. 130. a. 16.)

Are modals to be excluded from Logicl 1 speak of
Aristotla's modals only, which by no means carry with thern
all the rest. That the determination of the tmplted matter of
a petre proposition is extra-logical can hardly be denied; see
below, p. 42. But the case is not so clear with regard to the
capressed matter of a modal. On this I have remarked in
the Prelace. For authorities, see, on the one side, Sir
W. Hamilton in Ed. Rev. No. 115.; on the other, Kant,
Logik, ἓ. 30. and St. Hilaire‘s Translation, Prolata, p. 62.

¹ De inesse-roe ὑπάρχειν. We find two expressions in
Aristotle, both of which are sometimes rendered by “ beiay in.'’
1. ὑπάρχειν, by which the proclamo is said to be in the nrbject
This is equivalent to κατηγορεῖσθαι· τὸ Α ὑπάρχει παντὶ τῷ Β .-. τὸ
Ακαιηγορεῖται κατὰ παντὸς τοῦ B: All Β is A. 2. εἶναι ε’ν, by
which the subject is said to be in the ρννάὺιαὺι. A ἐστιν ἐν ὅλιρ
τῷ Β--ΑΙΙ Α is B. This is exactly the reverse of κατηγορεῖται.
The memorable question at issue between Reid and Gillias,
(see Hamilton on Reid, p. 684.) turns on this distinction. Tha
former uses “being in'’ as a translation of ὑπάρχειν, the latter,
of ἐν ὅλῳ εἶναι. ’
