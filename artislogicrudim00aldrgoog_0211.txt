to be beyond, or assumed& It is clear thcn that Petilio
Principii is not the fault with which the Syllogism is
chargeable, unless it ean be shewn tha't every statement
of an Universal Proposition must be, in this sense of the
term, beyyiny or ossumiay. If there are any cases in
which the assertion of such propositione depends' on
a warranted conviction, not on a gratuitous assumption,
from whatever source that conviction may arise, such
cases must be exempt from the charge of Petilio
Principii.

And if there be any such cases, the opponents of the
Syllogism have themselves unwittingly stumbled upon
a fallaoy cognate to> that with which they taunt its
defenders. For the Potitio Principii being in that case
a particular misapplication of the syllogistic method,
and postulating the latter as a condition of its prae-
tioability, they have inverted the relation of prior and
posterior, and assumed Potitio Principii to be neces-
sary to the existence of Syllogism.

But if, on the other hand, there are no such cases, and
the Syllogism is in consequence heneeforth to be
banished from Philosophy, what do 'we gain in ex-
ehange? We reduce the Laws of Thought from neces-
sary to contingent. We degrada certainty into probability,
and can claim for that only a subjective validity. But
until this latter hypothesis is proved, the Syllogism,

Tne Proper Syllogisms, however, though a post-Aristotelian innovation,
did not originate with Remus. Aquinas expressly denies thetboth premises
in a syllogism may be singular, and admits the ἔκθεσις as a non-syllogistio
process, being an appeal to the senses, not to the reason. See Opuso. xlvii.
