ΟΝ THE PREDICABLES.

Ι Ir has been already observed that the ordinary
logical account of the Predicables, even in its least
objectionable form, ss it occurs in the Isagoge of Por-
phy1y,cannotbe consistently maintained, except upon
Realist principles, By this is meant, that there are
portions of that account altogether untenahle, except on
the supposition that Genera and Species are not mere
conceptions of the human mind, but have an independent
existence in Nature. Whether they are to be regarded
as existing separately, as in the Platonis theory of ideas,
or in the individuals, according to the view sometimes
attributed to Aristode, (for both these opinions had their
advocates among the Schoolmen⁸,) is in this respect
immateria13 though it may be observed by the way, that
of the various modifications to which Realism has at
different times been subjected, the Platonic hypothesis

. is by far the most consistent and intelligible. The

⁸ Both were early, almost simidtansous‚ developments of the scholastie
Realism, appearing as soon as the Nominalism of Roscelin compelled the
antagonist doctrines to assume a definite form. The Platonis theory was
advocated by Bernard ot Char-trem the other, ultimately the prevailing
dochino, found its earliest scholastio supportat in William of champsaux·
