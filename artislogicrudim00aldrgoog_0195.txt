sense as “ animal’' is of “ man.'' Whereas Locke’s simple
ideas are exclusively ideas of attributes By reference
then to Aristotle‘s account of the latter, it will plainly
appear that he and Locke mean two very different
things by Definition. With the former, it is an in-
vestigation of the objectire cause of a phencmenon ;
with the latter, an analysis of the subjective impres-
sion which that phencmenon produces in the mind.
The idea of an intercepticn of light is not part of the
idea eclipse‚ but the one phenomenon is the physical
antecedent and cause of the other. Inquiries of this
kind are still classed among the most important problems
of Physical Science. What, for example, is light? Is it a
succession of material particles, or the undulations of an
elastic medium? Τὴθ solution of this question would
not be a Definition in Locke’s sense of the word3 i. e. it
would nothe an analysis of the idea of light produced
in the mind hy sensation. The same may be said of
colour. The mental sensaticn of whiteness or redness is
altogether unaffected by the researches of Optics. The
external cause of cclcur, regarded as a quality cf hodiem
falls directly within the province of the Science⁰.
The determination of such problems will be, in Aristode's
sense of the term, Definition.

This may be further illustrated by reference to a
discussion of Aristotle’s which few probably have perused
for the first time, without considering it as singularly
vague and unsatisfactory. I mean the dissertation
on Pleasure‚ in the tenth Book of the Nicomachean
Ethics We are struck with the absence of any thing like
a Definition or Analysis of the emoticn; and a render
who commences the study of the book with some previous
knowledge of Locke's theory of Simple Ideas, will
probably be disposed to regard it as an attempt to define
