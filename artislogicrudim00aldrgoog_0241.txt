of the same Propositions as ordinarily stated by the Geo-
metere. With regard to the second condition, the text
of Aristotle does not warrant its imposition. He says
indeed, that the middle term in demonstration must
be a definition of the major¹²‚· and the precept is
intelligible enough, if we rightly understand his theory
of the Definition of Attributes As 'regards the minor
term, it would be difficult to produce a single passage
where this condition is clearly laid down as a law of
Demonstration3 and there is more than one with which
it would be no easy taskto reconcile it. ⁵

If it be thought somewhat over-bold to repudiate
positions which sc ¹many eminent Logicians have
regarded as legitimate deductione from the text of
Aristotle3 it must be remembered that we have other ¹
data for interpretation besides the mere weight of autho-⁵ ,
rity. Aristotle’s theory of demonstration is principally
framed with reference to Geometry: the Scholastic ’
exampleS, on the other hand, are Physical. The medi· ⁴
aeval state of Physical science was perhaps such as to
justify, or at least to account for, the Logical and Meta-
physica] fictions connected with it3 aud to give a seeming
validity to the most potent demonstration of Risibility as
an emanation from Rationality; though that emanation.
was never dreamed of by Aristotle, and will scarcely claim
implicit belief in the present day. But it is not merely
because the revolution affected in this hranoh of Scienee
has invalidated the individua} example, that the inter-
pretation is objected t03 but because the words of Aris-
totle himself expressly direct us to another criterion.
