is the Definition sought3 if not, the object 01 inquiry is
not one but many. This methodis equally applicable
to Substanoes and to Attributes, though Aristotlc only
gives an example 01 the latter, the definition ο1 mag·
nanimity, gained by examining into the actions ο1 dif-
ferent magnanimous persons

Another importantremarlr of Aristotle's is, that although,
as we have already seen, demonstration, in certain cases,

’ must always precede. definition, yet no definition, as

such, 0011 be proved. This he maintains at some length
(against Xenocrates), in Anal. Post. i. 4. and shews that
every attempt at such demonstration necessarily involves
a petitio principii. The reason is obvious: since a
definition can be predicated essentially (ἓν τῷ 011011) 01
nothing but that of which it is a definition3 and since,
to prove a conclusion oonceming the essence, the pre-
mises must be of the same character3 the middle term
assumed must be identical with the minor, and the major
premise with the conclusion.

Such is Aristotle's Theory 01 Ι)01111111011. Its funda-
mental principle may still, mutatis mvttoadis, be retained,
notwithstanding that the speculations ο1 modern philo-
sophy have considerably modified his distinctions of
Substanoes and Attributes Properly speaking, indeed,
all Definition is an inquiry into Attributes. Our corn-
plex notions 01 Substances can only be resolved into
various Attributes with the addition of an unknown
substratum :-a something to which we are compelled to
regard these Attributes as belonging¹. Man, for example,
is analysed into Animality, Rationality‚ and the some-
thing which exhibits these phenomena. Pursue the
analysis, and the result is the same. We have a some-
