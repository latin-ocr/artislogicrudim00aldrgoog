an universal conclusion is logically drawn in this form,
which is not valid in the third figure cf Syllcgism.

We see then, that in the Inductive process the Copula
is ambiguous, expressing in the major promise* and in
the conclusion, the relation of a contained part to a
containing whole, in the minor promise, that of consti-
tuting parts to a constituted whole. This ambiguity has
been remarked as a deliciency in technical language⁰3
but there isno term sufficieutly naturalizcd in Logia to
serve as a substitute to express the latter relation.

On Induction‚ as exhibited above, it may be remarked,

1. That the distinction between a perfect and an im-
perfect Induction is extra-logical. Logia reccguises no
inference that is not necessitated hythe Lawsof Thought:
and therefore it must be presumed that the Induction is
perfect, i. e. that the Individuals mentioned arc in reality
the whole constituents of the species, before the In·
ductise Inference cau come in any way within the
province of the Logician. Το inquire what is the
wanant for this presumption; to ask what amount of
observation will warrant us in assuming X, Y, and Z, tc
be au the members of the class n; is like asking in
syllogistic reasoning, how do we know that the premises
arc true? undoubtedly a most important question, but
nct to be answered by Logia. So also any compromise
with material probability, any statement of the indi-
viduals as sarnpler cr adspirate representatione of their
class⁴¹, is a surrender of the essential principle cf
Logical Reascning: the parts cre absolutely the whole;
or the inference is, logically speaking, worthless.

It is manifest, however, that the Induction may be
easily stated in such a form, as to transfer the material
