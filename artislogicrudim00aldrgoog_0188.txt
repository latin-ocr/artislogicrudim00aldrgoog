arcannm. 15

In some passages, speaking in a stricter sense, Aristotle
declares Substances alone to be capable of Definition⁸;
but in the wider sense of the term which prevails through·
out the Posterior Analytics‚ it is applicable both tc
Substances and to Attributes In both cases the inquiry
into the Definition of a thing is identical with that into
its Cause3 with this distinction, that in the case of
Attributes, the Cause is to he sought, not in the Attribute,
but in its Subject; whereas in the case of Substances
which exist per se, the (lause is to be sought in themselves
only ¹¹.

Attributes are defined by the same cause which served
as a middle term to prove their existence. This is the
mode of Definition described as συλλογισμὸς τοῦ τί ἐστι,
πτώσει διαφέρων τῆς ἀποδείξεως. As an example, he gives
the definition of an eclipse. The moon is proved to he
eclipsed, because the sun's light is intercepted by the
earth. The same cause furnishes us at once vvith a

middle term for demonstration, and with a definition cf
the attributel. Why is the moon eclipsed? Because

’ From this it will be seen that ΜΓ. Mill has unjustly accused Aristode of
maintaining that the science of Geometry is deduced from Definitions.
(Mill’s Legio, vol. i. p. 197.) Hence may also be explained the contradiction
which Stewart professes to find in Aristotle's doctrines. (Elementa Pt. ii.
oh.8. secti.) The principles from which Aristotle demonstratae, are Axima,
of which he gives as a specimen, “ If equals be taken from equals, the
remaindcrs are equal.” The necessity of assuminp the existence of the
subject is maintained by Aristode as clearly as by Mr. Mill. ef. also

¹ The reduction of this Demonstraticn to syllogistic form has been
variously attempted. The following is given by Aquinas, Opusc. 38.
“ Omne corpus naturale, illuminatum a sole, privatum luce aterrae objectu
deficit; luna est hujusmodi, ergo luna deficit.’' A more general, and so far
preferable, major promise, is given by Crakanthorpe, Log. lib. iv. cap. 4.
