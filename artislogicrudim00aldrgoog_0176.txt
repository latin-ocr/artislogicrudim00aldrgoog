Species at Home, has an obvious and sufficient answer
I did not make the world, he might say; Substanoes,
universal as well as singular, exist independently of
me; I state facts as I find them, and am not bound to
determine why they are so. But let a Conceptualist or
Nominalistf talk of a Lowcst Species, and he is refuted at
once by his own fundamental doctrine. The several
Species are our own creation, as abstract ideae, or as
significatione of words. You have no right arbitrarily
to declaro that you will form complex conceptions thus
low and no lower 3 01, 01 least, if you fix such limits for
⁸ your own convenience, you have no right to impose the
same restrictiori on others.

The same remarks apply to the theory of 00 absolute
differentia, such as rationale, predicable of all men and
of none but men, and serving to distinguish that species,
not from some other given speciae, but from all others
whatever. Porphy1y,as hasbeen before observed, ad-

‘Between Nominalism and Conceptualism there is no real difforeuce‚
unless in conjunction with the latter we maintain the power 01 the mind
to form Universal notioris, unaided hy verhal or other symbols. And even
then, all Nominalism will be Conceptualism, though all Conceptualism
will not be Nominalism. For Universals cau only he identified with names
by considering these 00 the signs 01 notions. Yet Nominalism has been
accused as destructive 01 all Philosophy, and that hy tho advocates 01
Conceptualism. But the fundamental error 01 Hohhes 00111110 followers
is not their doctrine 01 Universal Tana, but their Theory 01 the impert 01
Proposttc'oar. The two, however, are not necessarily connected. We may
adopt Lacke’s theory 01 01011001 ideas, without maintaining with him that
knowledge is the perception 01 the agreement or disagreement 01 100
ideas; and 00 may hold that general 00110110 require the aid 01 lauguage,
without maintaining with Hobbes, that truth and falsehood depend ou
names, or with Gondillac, that science is only 0 language well constructed.
But, not to argue this point here, 00 [may observa, that the Scholastic
Nominalists, at least Ahelard and Occam, were Gonoeptualists. With
regard to Roscelin, it is hardly fair, upon the slight notices 00 possess 01
his views, to identify his Nominalism with that 01 Hobbes, whom Leibnitz
rightly calls, plusquam Nantuatis. No one can suppose Ahelard's 0100100110
ad absurdam to be 01011 statement 01Βο0001100 viows. ¹
