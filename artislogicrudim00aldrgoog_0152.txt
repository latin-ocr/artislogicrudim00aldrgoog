arripitur: idque vel Grammatieef, ut Musa est
Foeminini generis Ergo et Poeta .· vel Lopice, ut
Docere est opere, Ergo et Videre. Haec Materia

‘Grammatica i. e. inferring that Poeta is of the feminine
gender, because the majority of words with the same termina·
tion are sc. Lopice, inferring that videre belongs to the
category of ποιεῖν, because most infinitive moods of this form
are included under it.

The natural form in which this Fallacy would be stated is
that of an induction, or rather a number of examples efter
the manner of Socrates, Indeed, this very sophism is put
into the mouth of Socrates by Aristophanes, Nubes, 681 sqq.
Stated in this form, the logical inconsequenee is obvious; as
also if it is reduced to syllogism. “ Such and such words are
feminine3 Musa resembles such and such words” Here

Δ there is no middle term. This ambiguity is sometimes
called multiplea phantasticum Of. Petr. Hisp. Summ. Log.
Tract. vi. “Est autem multiplex phantasticum, quando aliqua
dictio significat unum et videtur significare alind propter
similitudinem quam habet in parte eum alia dictione ; ut videre
significat passionem, et videtur significare actionem, propter
hoc quod est simile huic verbo, apere.'' But the Fallacy would
seem more naturally to belong to those contradictionem.

In Rhet. ii. 24. 2. Aristotle gives another form of this
Fallacy; viz. when a series of detached propositione are so
enunciated as to appear logically connected, not being
really so. See also Soph. Elench. 15.'5.
