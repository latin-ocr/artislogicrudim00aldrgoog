The Nominalists on the other hand, expressly denied that
any predicable was of the essence of the individual. See
Occam, Logica, p. i. cap. 20, 21. To discuss the full bear-
ings of this controversy would exceed the hmits of a note.
It will be sufficient to observe, that a considerable portion of
the language adopted by Aldrich 16 161 6161 intelligible,
except on realistic principles; and that whenever the same
language is adopted by a Nominalist, he is inevitably involved
in inconsistencies and sels-contradictione. The 6611616111
some degree true of the original exposition of Porphyry,
though the latter professes to leave the question of Nomi·
nalism and Realism open. For the present I shall content

myself with stating so much of realistic views as may render
Aldrioh intelligible, reserving all else for the Appendix.

1 By the Realists, Universals‚ or at least Genera and
Species, were held to be Substances existing in the various
individuale of which they were predicable. According to
them there is an Universal moa, existing as one and the same
11 Socrates and Plato, 611 611 individuals of the Species. The
various individuale 616 formed by the addition of accidente 1ο
the Species. The latter are limited in number, and unaffected
by the distinction of the individuals, whose number is un-
limited. The mind, therefore, by abstraction, does not create
the Universals‚ but only becomes cognisant of what existed
before. By the NominalistS, Universals were held to be
notione existing only in the 11111611 created by Abstraotion.
The various modificatione of the two views need not be noticed
here.
