difficulty from the minor promise to the major; in which
case the question may be satisfactorily answered by that
Art or Scienee to which the Proposition materially
belongs, Thus the example given by Aldrieh might be
stated as follows:

’ The magnete which Ihave observed and also those which
I have not observed‚ attraot iron;

The magnete which Ihave observed, and those which I have
not obsewed, are all magnets;
Thercfore‚ all magnete attract iron.

In this mode of stating, the minor promise is unde-
niably true. The doubtful part of the major, relating to
the properties of unobserved objects, must be determined
by the analogies of the Science to which the objecto
belong, and by the material inquiry, what kind of
samples or specimens will warrant our asserting of
others what we have observed in them.

ΙΙ. It is precisely in the mode of answering this
material inquiry, that the whole difference lies between
the ancient Inductio per eriereerctioeem simplicem, and
that Interpretation of Nature insisted upon by Bacon.
The disciple of the former method‚ when asked‚ How do
you know that other specimens of your class possess the
same property as these? will reply, Because I have
never seen one which does not possess it. Ἠιθ Ba-
conian‚ on the othei· hand, will answer, Because Ihave
selected such instances as give evidence of an universal
law: Ι have examined those specimens of the class
which have nothing in common, except the possession
of the property in question: Ihave compared them with

objects not possessing it, and I find its absence always
accompanied by that of one of the essential attributes
of this class ⁰.
