expressed, but it seems -probeble that he regarded the
formul cause only as availablo for the purposes of De-
finition. For a material cause, properly speaking, has
no place in attributes, but only in physica] substanoes¹;
and that which in the former is most nearly analogous to
matter, viz. the necessary condition out oi which the
effect ariseS, may in such cases be identified with the
formal cause. This Aristode allows in the chapter in
question, when he states that the material cause there
instanced as a middle term is in fact the same as the

formale. The efficient and final causes seem to be
excluded, as not being contemporaneous with their

effects, so that from the existence of the one we cannot
certainly infer that of the other ¹. Whereas the formal
cause is expressly distinguished as τὸ τί ἦν εἶναιῆ and
the examples given of it in Anul. Post. ii. 121. corre-
spond exaotly to those previously given as Definitions.
The other causes only accidentally serve the same

purpose, in those instanoes in which they coincide with
the formale.

A very different view has been taken by some Logicians. Crakcnthorpe,
sor example, maintnins that Demonstration ean only be, “ a causa
