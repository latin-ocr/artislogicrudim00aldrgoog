A recent writer has exhibited the Inductive Method oi
Socrates as a specimen of that Induclio per enumera-
tionem simplicem which the Bacenian philosophy has
superseded‘. But it bas been before obserred that the
Socratis reasoning is not properly Inducliora but
Eccmpless. It is inconclusive, not because it is an
Induction by Simple Enumeration‚ but because it is no
Induction at all. The Simple Enumeration, if complete,
will form the basis of what, logically speaking, is a valid
Induction 3 and it is precisely because the Socratic
Method does not pretend to completeness, that Logic does
not recognise the inference. It is true thatin Simple Enu-
meration this completeness is often difficult, sometimes
impossible to attain. And it is the additional security on
this point that constitutas the chief meritos the Bacenian
process. But this is a rnalericl, not a lopiccl merit. It
affecte our pround of confidence in the truth of certain

propositions, not the recture of lle inference from those
propositio-ns assumed to be true. Neither in Induction

nor in Syllogism does the Organon of Bacon supersede
that of Aristotle. “ Each,’' as Sir W. Hamilton observes,
“proposes a different end3 both, in different ways, are
usefilllss' The ancient Philosopher considers “the laws
under which tle subject thinks ;'’ the medem, “ those
under which tlte object is tc be known.'' The Induction-
of Bacon, as fumishing more accurate rules for physical
investigation, may supersede the Induction of Socrates3
for the latter owes its validity solely to tbe matter. It
cannot effect the Induction of Aristode, of which the
validity depends solely on the form

The perversione of the Aristotehan Inductlon byAldrich
and Archbishop Whately hare already been noticed.0112
