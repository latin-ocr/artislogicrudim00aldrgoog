incorreot anulysis of the lavvs of the reasoning process3 it
may be that there are no such lavvs at all. But of either
of these positions the onus probandi lies with the assail-

antS, not with the defenders of the Syllogism. It is quite ‚Å¥

enough for the Logician, if he exhibit all that is generally

considered valid reasoning in a syllogistic form. If any -

maintain that a simpler or better type is attainable, he
waits with patience till they produce it. If all reasoning
is fallacious, he may be contented to behold his theories
fall in the general overthrow of all human knowledge.
But, pending the decision of this question, he may leave
his adversaries their choioe of one or the other horn of a
dilemma. If there are universal principles of truth not
entirely dependent on sensatim, the existence of such
principles will warrant syllogistic inferente. If there are
not, whatever be the value of our individual sensatione
all inferente from them, by induction, example, analogy,
or any method whatever, is, in respect of objectiva
certainty, worthless.
