’ The second 61 116666 opinions does not materially differ
from that definition of Logic which is proposed by Kant,
and sanctioned by Sir W. Hamilton, “The Science of
the necessary Laws of Thought‘1;'‘ a definition which
vindicatas to Logic its peculiar province as a branch of
menta] science, and fumishes the leading conception by
which we may hope one day to see it purified of the
incumbrances with which it has so long been overlaid,
and from which it has not yet been entirely emancipated.

The adoption of this definition necessitates a few re-
marks on a very different notion of Logic which has been
put forth in works extensively studied in this University.

Both Aldrichand ArchbishopWhatelyregard Language
as the principal object of Logic. The former speaks of
words as “vicaria signa, quorum usum idoneum docendo,
Logica mentem una ad bene operandum instruit.'’ The
latter goes further, and declares Logic to be entirely
conversant about language3 adding, “ if any process 61
reasoning can talre place in the mind, without any

employment of language, orally or mentally, (a meta-
physical question which I shall not here discuss) such
a process does not come within the province of the
science here treated of.” On the contrary, we may
maintain that the decision of the metaphysical question
in the negative is indispensably necessary, before the

on the object 61 Logic. 1Ι Conceptus formatus ab actu rationis. 2. Secunda
intentiones apphcatte primis. 3. Ens. 4. Oratio. 5. Argumentatio. 6. Syllo-
gismus. The three first as interpreted may he reduced to one, which is
substantially that 61 Aquinas.

6 In Kant's own words, ‘⁸ 61 1166 necessary Laws 61 the Understanding
and the Reason.” The inferences 61 Opposition and Conversion 666
regarded by him cs Syllogisms 61 1166 Understanding, (Verstandesschliissa)
the ordinary syllogisma as Syllogisms 61 1166 Reason. (Vernunftschliisse.)
The distinction (to say nothing 61 Kant's various employment 61 1166 term
Recson) is psychologically questionahle, and at all events would be out 61
place here, in commenting on 6 writer who adopts the ordinary division 61
1166 discrusive faculties.
