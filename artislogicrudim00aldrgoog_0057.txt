¹ Of summa Genera, Aristotle enumerates ten, commonly
called the ten (lategorios or Predicamenta' These are· οὐσία,
ποσόν, ποιόν, πρός τι, ποῦ, ποτέ, κεῖσθαι, ἔχειν, ποιεῖν, πάσχειν ,· usually
translated, Substance, Quantity‚ Quality‚ Relati0n‚ Place,
Time, Sitnntion, Possession‚ Action, Passion. The Cetegories λ
have by different commentators been regarded as a classifica Ι
tion of names, oi things and of both ; and have been alter·
nately banished to Metaphysics and recalled to Logic.
Whatever position they may hold in the Metaphysical uritings¹
of Aristotle, in his Logical ones they are expressly declared ιοΔ
headivision of the notions signified by simple terms. In this ’
point of view they may be defined as the different highest >
notions gained by continued abstraction from the subject and

different predicates of Propositions The subject will ulti· Ἴ

mately lead to the (lategory of Substance, the different pre-
dicates to the nine remaining Categories. The principle oi
distinction is probably psammetiral, as is shewn at some
length by Trendelenburg‚ Elementa, §. 3. q. v.

The six last (iategories may be reduced to Relatis see
Hamilton on Reid, p. 688. It should be observed‚ that Eas, ‘
(τὸ ὃν) is not a summum genus to the several (iategories,
being regarded by Aristotle, and most subsequent Philoso
phem, as predicable of them, not univocallp, but equivocally‚
or rather anolopously. On the Logical character os the Cate-
gorieS, and the objections raised against them by Kant and
others some able remarks will be found in St. Hilaire's
Translation‚ Preface‚ p. 68, sqq.

‘Species adulterare. Here the word species has changed
its meaning. In the original definition it meant a certain
relation in which a predicate may stand to its subject. Man
is a Species to Socrates. It now means a certain relation in
