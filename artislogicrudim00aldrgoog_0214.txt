envy hate :’' the latter is a singular Proposition, which
however is not regarded as a sign, except relatively to
some other Proposition, which it is supposed may be
inferred from it. The εἰκός, when employed in an Enthy-
mcme‚ will form the maycr premise of a Syllogism such
as the following:

Most men who envy hate,

This man envicS,
Thercfore‚ This man (probably) hatcs.

The reasoning is logically faulty3 for, the major promise
not being absolutely universal, the middle· torm is not
distributed.

The σημεῖον will form one promise of a syllogism which
may be in any of the three figureS, as in the following
exemplos:

Fig. 1. Fig. 2.
All ambitious men are liberal, All pregnant women are pale,
Pittacus is ambitious (Σ), This woman is pale t ),
Therefore‚ Pittacus is liberal. Therefore, She is pregnant.

Fig. 3.
Pittacus is good (alt,
Pittacus is wisc,
Thereforc‚ All wisc men are good.

eIu the first and second figures, the σημεῖον is clearly the minor
premise; this alone being singular. In the third, ae far as quantity is
concemed‚ we may choose between both premiscs. It seems more natural
however to prefer the major; because, in assigning a reason for our belief
in a given proposition, we should naturally states premise having either
the same predicate or the same subject ‚· not one in which the predicate ot*

the premise is the subject of the conclusion. For example3 Why do you ¹

believe Pittacus to be liberal? Because he is ambitious. Why do you
believe wise men to be good? Because Pittacus is good. This is fer more
natural than to answer, “ Because Pittacus is wise.” The same consideration
will frunish the data for interpreting an obscure passage in Anal. Pr. ii. 26.
5. which however it would excecd my present limits to attempt. The reader
will find it rightly explained ina note to St. Hilaire’s Translation‚ vol. ii.
p. 341. with the exception that the syllogism may be more clearly stated in
Gesare than in Camestres.
