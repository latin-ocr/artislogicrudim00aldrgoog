This mode of reasoning‚ as exhibited by Aristotle,
dces not directly appear in the same form as the former.
For in this the hypothesis is apremiae5 the conclusion
being the impossibility which has not been previously
enunciated. In the fornrer, the promises are both new
assumptions3 the conclusion being the antecedent of
the conditional proposition which was agreed upon as
a hypothesis. Both, however, agree thus far, that the
syllogistic portion of each does not differ inform from
an ordinary Syllogism3 and that in neither is the original
question syllogistically proved.

The notices of these Syllogisms in Aristotle are, it must
be confessed, sufficiently scanty. Thus much, however,
may fairly be gathered. Firstly, that, as regards form,
they are merely the common categorica] Syllogisms
applied to a particular purpose. Secondly, that their
conclusiveness, as regards the original question, is by

’ way of wrateriul, not of forteal, consequence. The

syllogism by agreement obviously refers to dialectic
disputation, and furnishes the grounds for amere arqu-
meutum ud horninem, in consequence of a previous
admission. Apart from'this special application‚ which
does not appear in the syllogism‚ the proof amounts to
this:

No X is C;

AssXmm

Therefore‚ Some A is not G.
Therefore, (by material consequence) Some A is not B.

ln the ἀπαγωγὴ asrielitarum, the proof is of the same
character. It has indeed no special reference to Dialectic,
andis frequently employed in demonstration‘‚ Aristotle's

‘For the principle os contradiction may be assumed as sels-evident,
without any convention between disputante. And in this lies the principal

differente between the deductio ad impossibile and the syllogismos agree·
ment, See Auel. Pr. i.44.3.
