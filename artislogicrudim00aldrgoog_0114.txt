estin, thymos, quod est mene, et monor, quod est unum, quasi
in' mente retinens unam propositionem.”‘ The erroneousness
of this etymology (besides its intrinsic absurdity) appears
from the word ἐνθύμημα being found in the Greek language
’ before it assumed a technioal meaning3 e. g. Soph. OE. 0. 292,
1199. Some Logicians attempt to distinguish between the
Logical and the Rhetorioal Enthymema (see Sanderson, b. iii.

ch. 8.) The distinction is not authorized by Aristotle, and is ’
liable to the objection which must always lie against awanton

alteration of the meaning of technical terms. For the Enthy-
meme of Aristode, see Appendix‚ note Et

⁰ The supposed minor is, of course, “ All magnete a're this,
that, and the other.” In this perversiori, Aldrich has been
preceded by Zabarella, De Meth. lib. iii. cap. 3. Archbishop
Whately departs still further from Aristode, and makes
Induction a Syllogism in Barbara with the major premise
suppressed. Thus:

“ That which belongs to this, that, and the other magneta,
belongs to all ; ⁸

Attracting iron belongs to thia, that, and the other ;

Theresor‘e it belongs to all.''
