are at issue, whether they are to he regarded 11 nominal,
01 11 imperfect real definitions⁰. The question is 01 the
less importance‚ inasmuch as Aristotle elsewhere cons
demus the use 01 such definitione altogether ¹. The
weight 01 authority is perhaps with the latter interpre⁶
tation. But, judging merely from the text 01 Aristotle,
the former seems 111 simplcr and more naunalr.

From the above statement it would appear that Nominal
Definition, according 10 Aristotle, is one in which there
is no evidence 01 the existence 01 objects to which the
definition is applicable. In form it need 1011101111111)1
differ from a Real Definition. There may he 1011111-
genus and a quasi-difference, 11 11 we defined a centaur,
“ 11 animal with the upper parts 011 man and the lower

’ parts 01 1 horse ;'' but, until we have ascertained the

existence 01 creatures possessing these characteristica
the definition is only one 01 the signification 01111111.

¹¹ 01 the 1011111 opinion are Averroes and Zabarella, who are followedby
M. St. Hilaire in his Translation 01 the Organon. The latter is maintained
hythe Greek Commentators, by Pacius, andin the recent Essays by
Rassow end Kiihn.

¹ See De Anima, ii. 2. 2.

Y The decision partly depende on the interpretation'of a doubtful
passage, Anat. Post. ii. 8. 4, rt δ’ εἰ ἔστιν ὁτὲ μὲν nard συμβεβηκὸς ἔχομεν,
ort δ’ ἔχοντές rr 111οῦ roi πράγματος. The instances which follow may
refer either to the one or the other.

'² It may be questioned whether the come Nominal Definitionis sanc-
110111 by Aristotle. Trendelenburg indeed (Elementa, §- dt.) 10 rendere
the λόγος dromedas 01 An. Post.ii.10.1. and the interpretation, ifcorrect,
would seem to shew that Nominal, as well 11 Real Definitions must be
1111111011,Ι but the context, λόγος τοῦ ri σημαίνει rh ὄνομα ἦ adyta ἕτερος
1101111111111111 rather 1011111, “ a Definition 01 the signification 011
name, 0101 another sentence having the 10101 01 1 11111.” 01 the other
interpretation, the word ἕτερος 11 superfluous, and the example, olor ah τί
σημαίνει ri 11111νῇ τρίγωνον, unintelligible. By λόγος 1101111τῶ111 11 there
1011 meant a sentence whose signification, like that 011 single noun, is
ope. Such are all real Definitions, 01 which the example is a specimen.
