Species is excluded from the Predicables, and confined·
to the Species subjicibilis, the correlative of the Predicable
Genus. By this we avoid an inconsistency of which the
majority of Logicians are guilty, in employing the term
Species sometimes to express a relation of a Predicate to
a Subject, sometimes that of a Subject to a Predicate.

A lowest Species will be admissible, as 'it implies a,
notion so complex as to be incapable of further ae.-⁴
cessione. Itis true that, in the continual formation of-
Species‚ we may arrive at combinatione of attributes not
realised iu Nature3 but the elassification of things is not.
the province of the Logician; nor has he a right to con-
clude a priori that the field of physical research is exe
hausted, or that notions now regarded as imaginary may
not hereafter be discovered to be real. But whether such
discovery be made or not, it will not affect the relation
of two notions to each other. Even within the field of.
reality‚ the ordinary limits are most arbitrarily fixed.
Man is regarded as a Species to Animal, Philosopher is
not regarded as a Species to Mau. Yet what distinction
can be drawn between the relations of these notions to
each other? Itis true that some olassifications are far
more important than others in Physical Science, and,
relatively to particular ScienceS, those species may be
fixed as the lowest, at which the more numerous and
important variatione of phenomena terminate. In this
sense, each Science may have its lowest species, at which
its investigation of properties eeases‘¹⁸ But this limit
cannot be acknowledged by the Logician. He. lmows
nothing of the respective values of different physical
classifications. That question must be determined by
other Scieuces, and even when determined will not affect
the Logical relations of Subject and Predicate.
