rumque duo (etsi interdum plura) proponit adver-

But either G is not D, or G is not H;
Either A is not B, or Ε is not F.

There cannot be a simplo destructive Dilemma of this kind,
as is shewn by Abp. Whately, Logic, b. ii. ch. 4. ἓ. 5.

The Dilemma is sometimes exhibited in another form, as a
conditional syllogism, in which the consequent of the major
promiscis disjunctive, and tho whole denied in the minor;
e. g. “ If A is B, G is D, or E is F, or G is H; but neither O is
D, or Ε is F, nor G is H; therefore A is not B.'' This form is
given by Wallis, lib. iii. cap. 19.; as well as by Wolf and Kant.
But it is a perversion of the Dilemma proper, and introduces
no distinction whatever; being merely e common disjunctive
syllogism, as is shewn by Wallis himself. It is, in fact, the
enumeratio, not the complexio, of Cicero,

¹ These remarks entirely relate to the matter, and have
nothing to do with the Logical character, of the Dilemma.
See Whately, ii. 4. 5.
