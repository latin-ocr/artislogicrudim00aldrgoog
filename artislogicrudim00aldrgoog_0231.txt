not pf tte Spllcyism, it is allowed that some A is net B.
The Syllogism in form is an ordinary Categorical in the
third Figure3 the Conclusion, however, not being the
original question, bnt the antecedent of a Hypothetical
Proposition, of which the question is the Consequent‘.
The ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ dirivato is also Oategorical‚ so far as
it is Syllcgistic. In this, the Conclusion syllogistically
proved is a falsehood ; the original question being
inferred only by Hypcthesis, because a falsehood results
from the assumption of its contradictoryv. The Hypotbesia
in this case is, that the contradictory is true‘. Thus, if it
be required to prove that some A is not Β, we reason
from the assumption cf the contradictory,
All A is B ;
All G is A ; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)
Therefore, All O is B.

The Conclusion being supposed to be a known falsehood.

⁰ Ἐν ἅπασι γάρ ό μὲν συλλογισμός γίνεται πρδς τδ μεταλαμβανόμενον, τδ δ’
ἐξ ἀρχῆς περαίνεται δι’ ὁμολογίας ἦ τινος ἄλλης ὑποθέσεως. Anal. Pr. i. 23. 11.
Τὸ μεταλαμβανόμενον is explained by Alexander as applying tc the conclusion
of the syllogism‚ because it is taken in a different manner from that in
which it was originally enunciated3 being at first part cf a conditional
agreement, and afterwards acategcrical conclusion. For this reason, the
syllogism is said to be κατὰ μετάληψιν. Anal. Pr. i. 29. ὑ. Were it not for
this authority, it would seem simpler to interpret μετάληψις merely “change
of question ;” the disputant turning from the original question to the proci
cf another on which itis supposed to depend. Conceming the other kind
of hypothetical syllogisms mentioned in the same passage, those nard
ποιότητα, we have nc data for even a plausible conjecture. M. StHilaire's
explanation is forced. Philoponus, (Scholia, p. 178, b. 9.) says itis a
syllogism, ἐκ τοῦ μᾶλλον, ἡ ἐκ τοὺ ἧττον, η ἐκ τοῦ ὁμοίου.

syllogism lor the instance given by Aristode, on account of its intimacy,
end the length requisita tc expand it. The render will find it explained
by Waitz, vol. i. p. 430.
