sensuum. 65

It is not denied that there are passages in Aristotle
which may seem to oountenance this interpretation3 but
there are others so palpably inconsistent with it that
we are compelled toseek fora new'explanation of the
former.

In the first place, Aristotle distinctly condemns the
assumptiones Definitions as a Petilio Principia In the
second place, he says that Demonstratiou proceeds fiom
amiotus, and cites as a specimen of the latter, ‘⁶ If equals
be taken fiom equaIS, the remainders are equal ¹¹.” These
axioma, he says, are commento many classes of objects3
but, in any single Soience, need 'only be assumed to an
. extent commensurate with the object-matter of that
7 Science. Τὴθ above axiom‚ for example, is true of

' other things besides Geometrical Magnitudes but it is ‘

sufficient for the Geometer to assume it as true of these ²
only.

Now if au axiom of this kind be the major premise in
a Demonstration‚ it is manifest that its predicate will

’ also be the predicate of the Conclusion3 and that the

logical form of that conclusion will be, not “ All triangles
are figures having their angles equal to two right angles‚”
but, “ Triangles and figures having their angles equal to
two right angles are equal to each other.”

The immediate Syllogism from which this proposition
is proved by Euclid, may be logically stated as follows:

“’ Magnitudes equal to the adjacent exterior and interior
, angles os a triangle are equal to each other ;
The three interior angles and two right angles are equal to
the adjacent exterior and interior angles;

· η · Therefore, they are equal to each other.”
