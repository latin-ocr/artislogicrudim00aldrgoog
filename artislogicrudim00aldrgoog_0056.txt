sarmitum specillo, desumere differentibus. But this would not
be allowed by Porphyry, according to whom differentia is
always predicated dc metir delectantia. The remaining
’ definitione might be supplied as follows ; Spectas, quod de
plutone aalma differentibus ia Quia Propriam, qaod dc plumbaea
comem afferentibus ria oeae. Accidens, quod de plantas gerrem
cel specle cel amnem differentibus ia Quale. The two last, how·
ever, are not given as definitione by Porphyry.

¹Genus is a whole in Prodiratioa containing various
species as subjecte under it. Species is a whole in Desitiates,
containing genus and differentia as parts os the essenoe.
Hence if we consider Definition as within the province of
Metaphysics, (see p. 33‚n0te1,)the latter relation of part to
whole may fairly be called Metophysicel. The former may
be called Lepieal, as implied in the Logical theory of thc
Propositiom as well as in the dictam dc emal et ardh. But the
nomenclatura is objectionabla as introducing a point at issue
between two schoola and inconsistent with Aldrich's sub·
sequent compromise between them in Definitio Metapltysica
sive Loqicc. It is better to cell Genus Totam Universcla
Species Totam Eacatiala of. (lrakanthorpe, Logica, lib. ii.
