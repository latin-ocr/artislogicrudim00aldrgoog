Platonic writings 3 and ifthis Dialectic he intended, ’
Metaphysios would, now at least, better express the
character of thedivision. Aristotle has sometimes, on
the strength of a passage in the Topics, been considered
as adopting the same classification¹. Amore groundless
conjecture has seldom ,been hazarded. The single
passage adduced in its support occurs in a work treating
of dialectis disputation, and of propositions vicwed with
reference to that purpose. The theory based on it is
opposed to the interpretation of the oldest commeritatorr,
and is inconsistent, not only with Aristotle’s own con-
stant use of the word λογικός, but with his well-known
division of theoretioal Philosophy into Physica, Mathe-

. matios, and Theology2. The reader who is acquainted

, with Ritter’s account oi Aristotle’s Philosophy, will be
