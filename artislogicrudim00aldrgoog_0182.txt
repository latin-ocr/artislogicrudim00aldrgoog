the'compariso'n from which these distinctions arise having
ceased.

With this proviso, we may adopt, mutatis mutandis, the
classifioation of the Predioables given by Aristotle him-
self, as fumishing a more satisfactory groundwork than¹
either the Isagoge of Porphyry, or its subsequent scho-
lastic embellishments. Every Proposition‚ according to
Aristode, expresses one of four relations of the Predioate
Ἰ to its Subject3 Genus, (under which may be included
Differentia) Definition, Property‚ or Accidentr. For
every Predioate must either be convertible with its
Subjeot or not.. If convertible, it either expresses the
whole Essence (τό τί ἦν εἶναι) of the Subject or not. In
the former case it is called Definition, in the latter,
Property. If not convertible‚ it either expresses pert of
the Essenoe or not. In the former case it is Genus, in
the latter, Accident.

This division, being founded on dichotomy by contra·
diction, must necessarily exhaust every possible mode oi
Predioation. Interpreting the Essenos, in accordance
. with our present vieW, as the sum of the attributes
comprehenderis a notion, we shall find all four memr
bers admissible where the Subjeot of the proposition
has both comprehensim and extensiom i. e. is a complex
notion containing attributes and is predicable of existing
objeots. For its Predioate may either express a whole·
or apert of the attributes comprehended in the subject,
or else some attribute not so comprehended, but possessed
by the objeots of which the subjectis predicable. In
the latter case, where the Subject and Predioate are

¹¹ See Topica, i. 8. Sundry attempta have been made, not very success-
tuly, to reconcile this account with that of Porphyry. But though some
license of interpretation may be allowed, when the objectis to reconcile an
author with himself, it is scarcely necessary tc strein his language into
agreement with avnnr who lived more than six centurics after him, and
who does not even profess to be commenting on him.
