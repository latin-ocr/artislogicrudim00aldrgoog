of the subtleties of the parva logicalio, derived by the School-
men, through Petrus Hispanus, from the Greek Logia of
Michael Pselliis. Suppositio was defined to be ‘⁸ deceptio
termini substantivi pro aliquo;” thus the term tonso, naturally
applicable to men of all generations is in the proposition
borno currit, accidentally limited to existing individuale. In
this case it was said, in not very classical Latin, “ homo suppmcd ’
pro praesentibus'’ In the same sense, Psellusemploys ὑποτίθησι.
For further information on the various kinds of supposition‚
the curious reader may examine Sanderson's Logie, b. ii.
ch. 2.

‘¹ Vota complana (φωνὴ συμπεπλεγμένη) in Aristotle signifies a
compound word; his example is ἐποκπροκᾶης, of which each
part has a meaning in composition. Vox simplex (ἁπλῆ) where
the parts have no meaning. The later meaning of voc compara '
properly corresponds to Aristotle's λόγος (Oratio), and is not
limited as by Aldrich‚ to the Propontioa (oratio enunciativa). γ’
Thus Petrus Hispanus: “ Vocum significativarum ad placitum

alia complexa, ut worn, alia incomplexe, ut nomen et ver· ,

bum. Orationum perfectarum aha indicativa, ut borao macrii,-
alia imperativa, ut Petra soc ipson: alia optativa, ut minam
esset bonos choicum alia subjunctiva, ut si uenena ad me dabo
tibi equum alia deprecativa, ut miserem mei Deus. Harum
autem orationum, sola indicativa oratio dieitur esse propo·
sitio.'’ Sum. Log. Traet. l. cf. Boeth. de Syll. (iat. p. 582. ι

With regard to the coc decemplicem as λόγος is defined by ¹
Aristotle as a species of φωνή, and syllogism asa speeies of
λόγος, the latter may without error be called vox„ But the
distinction is unnecessa1y; the syllogism, assor as apprehension ⁴
ia consented, being only three several propositions. The con-
nexion between them is not a matter of apprehension‚ but of ,
reasomng.
