known distinction of Leibnitz, between intuitive and sym-
bolical knowledge, the province of the latter is declared
with some hesitation. “ Et certe cum notio valde composita
est, non possumus omnes ingredientes eam notiones simul
cogitare: uhi tamen hoc licet, vel saltem in quantum
licet, cognitionem voco intuitivam. Notionis distinctae
primitivae non elia datur cognitio, quam intuitiva, ut com·
positarum plerumque cogitatio non nisi symbolica est⁰.''

Praetically, then, on account of the necessities of uni-
· versal propositions and complex notione, Logic is com·
pelled to make use of symbols. Whether the symbols of
thought need necessarily he the same as those of speech¹ 3
and whether, if deprived of the latter, we could invent
other symbols or even dispense with any3 and whether
the domain of thought would thereby be narrowed or
enlarged, its operatione facilitated or retarded 3-these
and similar questions would be out of place here, and in
any place are rather curicus than useful. As a matter of
fact, men do reason by means of language. We are
morally certain that they will continue to do so, as long
as that instrument remaina Further speculation leads
to little more than the not very edilyu'ng conclusion, that
man would certainly be constituted as he is not-if he
were not constituted as he is.

supposed, furnish any argument sor the negative side. The absence of
sound produces, as far os we know, a corresponding change in the symbols
both of thought ond communicetiom but this furnishes no new data for
determining their relation to each other.
