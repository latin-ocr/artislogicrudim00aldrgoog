ΟΝ INDUOTION.

INDUOT10N,as far as it is a Logical process at all, is
equally formal with Syllogism; though proceeding in
the inverse order ; viz. from the aggregate of indiiiduals
to the universal whole constituted by them3 instead of
from the whole to the several individuals contained
under it. It is defined by Aristotle, “ proving the
major term of the middle by means of the minor⁸;”
in which definition, the expressions major, middle, and
minor, are used relatively to their extensive, to designate
respectively the attribute proved, the constituted species
of which it is proved, and the aggregate of individuale by
which the species is constituted. The form in which the
Inductive Reasoningl naturally appears, exhibits an
apparent, though not a real, resemblance to the third
figure of Syllogism. Thus:

X, Y, Z, (minen) are B (major);
X, Y, Z, are all A (middle); therefore,
All Α is B.

The resemblance to the third figure is apparent only3
’ the true distinctions being, 1. That in the minor premise
of the Induction‚ the copula does not represent the
subject as carticined ander, but as constitutinq, the
predicate. 2. That in consequence of this distinction,

¹² In aloose sense, Aristotle calls it t ἐξ ἐπαγωγῆς συλλογισμός, where
the word does not denote the syllogism proper, or reasoning lrorn the
universal whole to the contained parts, but is extended to formal reasoning
in general. In like manner, in Rhet. ii. 25. Β. he speaks ol the Enthymemo
as including Exempla.
