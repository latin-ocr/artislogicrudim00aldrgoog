¹ Most Logicians reckon two principal methods of
nominal definition: 1. by a synonymous term, e. g. ‘⁸ ensis
est gladius:” 2. by Etymology, as in Aldrich’s example.
The former is in fact translation, it being indifferent whether
the synonyma belong to the same language or not ; the latter
will in many cases be no definition at all; alarge number of
words having quite lost their etymological meaning. Neither
of thesemethods are countenanced by Aristotle; see Appendin
noteB. The formermaybetracedtethe Greek Commentators3
see Alexander, in Metaph. p. 442. ed. Bonitz. The latter is an
innovation borrowed from the Rhetoricians, by whom it was
called Notaui). See Cicero, Top. ch. 8.

⁰ Accidental definition is ‘composed of genus and one οῖ’
more proportior. Accidents properly so called aro expressly
rejected as useless in definition by Porphyry, Isag. 3. 15. und
by Boethius, Opera, p. 3, though admitted by some Subsequent
authorities. Hence animal mathide would be a better example
than Aldrioh's animal bipes implume. But the majority of
Logicians have very properly regarded occidental definition,
in any form, as no definition, but merely tasmpttoa. Of. Albert.

1² Metaphysical definition, the only proper definition in the
striot sense of the term, being by genus and differentia, (or
more correctly by genus and differentia· see Top. i. 8, 8.
and cupra p. 20, note r.) it will follow, that all definable
notions must be moues. Hence samma ponera, which have nc
differentiae, and individuale, which are distinguished only by
accidents, are not definable. See Arist. Metaph. iv. 3, 6.
