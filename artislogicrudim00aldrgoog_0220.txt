Auruncis. 47

or Rhetorical reasonings are founded on τᾶπη the
others on the peculiar principles of that Scienoe or Art
to which they helongl.

This passage is generally found puzzling to a beginner
cn two accounts Firstly, he is apt to fancy Dialeotio
synonymous with Logic, and to confound it with the
formal Soience of that name3 an error which the Gom-
mentary most likely to fall in his way is not unlikely
to confirm. Secondly‚ having previously seen the Enthy-
meme defined as the Rhetorical Syllogism3 there seems

¹ some inconsistency in the subsequent observation, that
some Enthymemes are Rhetorical, others not so.

In explanation it may he observed. Firstly‚ that
Dialeotio and Rhetoric are not formal ScieneeS, but
material Arts. Their Logia is not a Lopico decena,
treating of the general form of Reasoning, but a Loyiea
alena, treating of Reasoning as applied to a particular
matter. That matter is fiunished hythe τόποι. Rhetorio
and Dialeotic do not merely lay down the form in which
their reasonings ought to prooeed‚ but likewise provide
certain general principles of probability, from which the
matter of their major premises is to be drawn. These
τόποι or common-places hold the same position in the
Dialeotio Syllogism‚ as the most universal kind of
axioms in the Demonstrative. They are not gained by
exclusive observation of any one particular class of ’
objecta belonging to this or that art or faculty, but are
indifferently applicable to all. Such is the example
quoted by Aristotle as ὁ τοῦ μᾶλλον καὶ ἦττον τόπος. of
this in the Topics he gives four cases, of which the
following may be taken as a specimen. ‘⁶ If the more
likely assertion on any subject be untrue, the less likely
is probably untrue likewisefi A general maxim of this
