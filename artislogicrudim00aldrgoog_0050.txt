“ whiteness‚” 10. 010 iramed from marks presented by natural
objecta. The conceptions “ 8011110,” “ species,'' “ accident‚”
“'predicable,'' “ universal‚” 10. are formed from the first in·
tentions themselves viewed in certain relations to each other.
Hence the former 010 predicable 01 the objects immediately;
we may' say, “ thetis 0111011,” “ 11101 10 white ;” the latter are only
Ι ’ predicable 01 words or notione, ’1111111 is a species” Hence

· intentionis ;, it 10 1101 11100111 that 011 universals are ia themselves
’ second intentions; but that every predicate viewed 10 relation

³ to 111 11111001 may be comprehended under one 01 Porphyry's
five classes 01 predicables; all which are second intentione.
So when Genus 10 said to be predicable of SpecieS, it is not
= meant that we can predicate the one second intentionof the
other, so 00 10 say, “Species is Genus;” but that the first
intention ‘⁶ animnl' is predicable 01 the first intention ‘⁶ man ;”
, the relation 01 the one to the other being expressed by the
second¹ intentione ‘1‘ Genus' and “ Species” For this reason
- Logic was said 10 11001 01 second intentione applied to fleat. See
Aquinas, Opusc 111. scotus, Sup. Univ. Qu. 3. Zabarella‚ De
Natura Logieae, lib. i. cap. 19.

The distinction between first and second intentions is
generally considered as 01 Arabian origin. Suetus, however,
(Sup. Univ. Qu. 3.) attributes it 10 Βο01111110, whose extant
writings do not confirm the statement. It is found in Averroes,
Epitome de Predieamentis ad fin. For scholastic expositione,

definition, which 10 extremely vague though not positively
erroneous, was probably suggested by Gralranthorpe, who in
his Praemium calls second intentions Voeer Artis Logiece. Itis
scarcely necessary to add, that the explanation 01 Abp. Whately
is altogether erroneous.
