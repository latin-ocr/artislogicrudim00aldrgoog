instance given above, may we not call the fact that “this
man envies,’' a siqu that he batos, as well as the general
statement a likelihood? Does not the whole distinction
depend on the question, which is the stated, which the
suppressed, premise?

To this it may be replied, that Aristotle distinguishes
the εἰκὸς and σημεῖον merely as propositions, and no where
says that they may not be combined in the same syllogism.
ln the instance given, it so happens that the minor pre-
mise is a singular proposition, and may fairly be con-
sidered a alyn of the conclusion. But we might obviously
employa minor promise of another kind, such as, “ All
malignant men are envious;’' in which case there is,
properly speaking, no slya employed in the reasoning.
But this does not affect the distinction between the two
Propositions. A likelihood is such, per se,-a Proposition
stating a general trutb, which we are at liberty to apply
or not to particular cases A sign is a sign of something
else,-—a single fact stated as a proof of something further3
which proof may, according to material circumstances,
be⁰ logically or only morully conclusive.

Another question sometimes raised is, “ If the Enthy-
meme has both premises supplied, how is it to be
distinguished from the Dialectic Syllogism l” Το which
it may be answered, that, taking the word Syllogism in
its strictest sense, as a reasoning logically correct, the
same argument may in different points of view be con·
sidered either as a Syllogism or an Enthymeme. This
is, of course, only the case with the τεκμήριον; the other
specimens of the Enthymeme being logically invalid.
The argumentation ἐκ τεκμηρίου, is in this sense both
an Enthymeme aud a Syllogism ;-an Enthymeme on
material grounds, inasmuch as its premise is a ripn
of its conclusion ;-a Syllogism on formal groundS,
inasmuch as it complics with the conditione of logical
