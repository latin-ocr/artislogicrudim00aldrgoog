authorities. This Ait, as exhibited iu the Topics, must
not be confounded with the formal theory ol reasoning
developed in the Prior Analytics. The application of
the syllogistio form might indeed give to the dialectis
disputation a greater degree of method and precision.
But Aristode lihewise gave to his Dialectic a decidedly
material character, by means οξ the collection of τόποι, or
general principles-of probability, from which the pre·
mises of the disputante were to be drawn. The discus-
sion was carried on by oue party undertaking to defend,
the other to abach a given thesis. Each selred his
opponent to grant certain promises, which ought primo
faeie to be sufficiently probable to gain the assent of the
other. These being granted, he endeavoured to deduce
from them his own conclusion, or to involve his antagonist
in contradictione resulting from such concession.

The logical aud the dialectical syllogisms of Aristotle
will therefore denote the same class of reasonings, but in
slightly different points of view3 the former representing
them as derived from mere general grounds of pro-
bability3 the latter, us fitted, as all such reasonings must
be, rather for the disputations of the dialectioiun, than
for the demonstrations of sciense.

If then we were to employ the word Logio solely in
conformity with the use of its cognate terms by Aristotle,
it would be material and not formal, an Art and not a
Science. But, in that case, far from being coextensive
with the subjectos the Organon as a whole, it would
correspoud only to the two last treatises, the Topics and
Sophistic Restitutions, and would have considerably more
affinity to the Rhetorio theuto the Anclytics.

A division of Philosophy into Logic, Physica and
Ethics, has been attributed, on the authority of Cicero ¹¹,
