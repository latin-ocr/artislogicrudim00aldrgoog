Ρ The complete example comprises both an imperfect in-
duction and a syllogism, in the following form:

Pisistratus aimed at tyranny,
Pisistratus asked for a guard,
(Therefore) All who ask for a guard aim at tyranny ;
Dionysius asks for a guard,
(Therefore) Dionysius aims at tyranny.

The Example differs from the Induction in two respects.
lst, Induction proves the universal from a complete enume-
ration of the individuals; Example selects single cases. 2dly,
Induction stops at the universal; Example infers syllogistically
a conclusion regarding another individual. The Example is
defined, An. Pr. ii. 24. 1. “proving the major of the middle
bya term resembling the minor.” It is thus distinguished
from Induction, which is said to prove the major of the middle
by the minor. Anal. Pr. i. 23. 2. The definition has reference
to the conclusion of the inductive portion of the Exemplo:
“ aiming at tyranny,” being the major; “ asking for a guard,'’
the middle ; “ DionysiuS,” the minor; ‘⁴ Pisistratus,” the ὅμοιον.

The Example is sometimes loosely called, “ reasoning from
Analopy.” See Mill's Logic, b. iii. ch. 20. The latter term pro
perly signifiesareasoningfounded notonabsolute resemblance,
but on resemblance of Retico. Such is the παραβολὴ mentioned
by Aristode, Rhet. ii. 20. 4; the relation of a rulerto astate
being similar to that of a pilot to a ship. In the same way it
might be argued that obedienee is due from a colony to the
mother-country, as from a child to a parent. Neither the
analogy, nor the example proper, have any loytcat force.
Logic recognises none but formal consequence. That there
is none such in these, may be seen by putting them into

symbolical form. Thus; A and B are both X, A is also Y,

· therefore B is Y. (Example.) Or; Ais to B as O to D, Ais X,

therefore G is X. (Analogy.) Their moral force may vary,
according to circumstances from zero to moral certainty. In
short, they are morehel inferences‚ and, as such, have place in
Rhetoric‚ but not in Logic. See further, Introduction, p. xiii.
