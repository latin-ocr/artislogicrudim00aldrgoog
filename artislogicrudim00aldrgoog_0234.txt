if the felsehood of the alternative is evident without it.
We heve thus the Disjunotive Syllogism.

We may agree therefore with M. St. Hileire thus for,
that thoughthe form of the Hypothetioul Syllogism is not
explioitly exhibited in the extant writings of Aristotle,
we hove nevertheless the dato from which it needs but
one step to develope it. Whether that step was tehen
by Aristotle himself in o lost work, or supplied by his
disoipleS, is a point of little consequence. Externa}
testimony is deoidedly in favour of the latter supposition,
e testimony which the most zeelous admirer of the
Stagirite need not be very solioitous to overthrow. The
subsequent discovery, if suoh it be, only furnishes on
additional illustration of the philosopher's own longuage
at the close of his logiool lebours. Μέγιστον γὰρ ἴσως

κράτιστον τῇ δυνάμει, τοσούτῳ μικρότατον ὃν τῷ μεγέθει χαλεπώ-
