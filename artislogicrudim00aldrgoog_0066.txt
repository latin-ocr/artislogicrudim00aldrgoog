(i. 1, 16.) the threefold division of real definition has been

fathered on the Stagiritc. For a fuller account ol Aristotle's

doctrine, see Appendix, note B.

ι ¹Mctopbysica siae Loyioo. On this point the two great

sects of the Schoolmen were at issue. The RealistS‚ following 1
the Arabiane, divided Logic into two parts ; one, which treated

of the essence of incomplex notions and things by deflentem

the other, of the truth of propositione as determined by

. argumentation. To this latter the greater part of the Aristo-

“ ¹ telian Logic was regarded as belonging. The former was

· supposed to have formed a lost portion of the ancient science.

Ἀ The Nominalista on the other hand, and more correctly‚

maintained that to investigate the essences oi things belonged
to the province ol Metaphysics; the Logician, as such, assigning
no actual definitione but borrowing them as mere examples

. ¹from the science to which they properly belong. As autho·

r-ities for the two viewS, compare Albert, de Praedicab Tract. i.

. chap. ὅ, 6. with Occam, Legio, part i. ch. 26.

¹¹ Physical definition is rejected by Aristode, (Metaph. vi.
11.) on the ground that the physical parts are not parts of the

’ < species but of the individuale. Aldrich's expression, ‘¹ partes
, recoctio physicae,” cannot be tolerated, unless we regard univer-

sal notions as not merely real substances, but corporeal. Iu
the example given by Aldrich, the socalled Physical definition
may be regarded as merely an indirect mode of expressing
the same notion that the Metaphysical definition expresses
directly. Itis thus merely an accidental variation of lan·
guage easily reduced to the direct form, and is so regarded
by Albert, de Praed. Tract. i. ehap. 6. and by Occam, ptl
ch. 26. In all other cases it is no definition at all
