Worlra p. 242, 692. Hence Aristotle's division, which is
psyoiolopc'col, will not exaatly correspond. The nearest ap·
proech to Simple Apprehension is ἡ τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νοὴοιςς
but νοήσας is variously used, and in its widest sense will
embraae‘ all the logical operations and even φαντασία, which
belongs rather to the pereeptive soul. See de Ari. iii. 3. 8.
Judgment will correspond nearly to the ὑπιδηψις of de An.
iii. 3. 7. (cf. Trendelenburg de An. p. 469.) The latter
term however is inapplioable to the cognition of axiomatie
truths. Discursus answers to διάνοια and λογισμός, the former
term being applied both to the faculty and its operation.
But there is much uncertainty in the use of all the above
terms. cf. Biese, vol. i. p. 89, 327. Hamiltou's Reid, p. 768.

¹1Indistinctness of Apprehension may be remedied by
Definitiou, (and by Division as subordinate to in) as we are
thereby enabled to ascertain the exact eontents oi anotion‚
and to distinguish it from those with which it is most likely
to be confounded. Logia however does not frunish us with
definitione, but only tells us under what conditione the process
is possible, and gives mles for performing it. Neither aan
Logia tell us whether any given Definition is correan- tho
correctness of a definition being however a different thing
from its distinetness: af. Smiglecii Log. disp. ii. Qu. l. disp. iii.
Qu. 5. See further, Appendix, note B.

ί Falsity of J udgment may be remedied by Logia, so far as
the judgment is a derived one (ὑπόληψις), gained by the Reason
(διάνοια), either by immediate inferenae, as in opposition and
conversion, or mediare, as iu induation and syllogism. Logia
can give no rules for tasting the truth of independens judg-
