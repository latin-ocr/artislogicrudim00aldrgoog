aduam, ejusque significatum Unum numero: neque
enim singulare est quicquid Unum dici potest; sed
multa, quae sunt invicem similia, eatenus Unum
censentur. Vocantur enim uno eodemque nomine;
quod ipsa Vocis definitio1¹¹ non patitur, nisi in illis
reipsa sit, vel saltem concipi possit, una aliqua
eademque Natura, quae huic nomini respondeat.
Talem reperit intellectus, dum plura contem-
plando abstrahite ab eorum differentiis3 i. e. spectat

¹¹· Vocr'a detnato. Since Vox is “ signum rei vel conceptm,”
not rerum vel corwcptuum.

¹ abstrahit. Abstraction is, properly speaking, the sapa·
ration of one portion of the attributes coexisting in any
object from the rest. In this sense Geometrical Magnitudes
are called by Aristotle τὸ ἐξ ἀφαιρέσεως, (An. Post. I. 18. 1.);
because the Geometer considers only the properties of the
figure, separating them from those of the material in which
it is found. (See An. Post. I. i. 6.) On similar grmmds
is formed the scholastic distinction of obstruet and concrete
terme ; since in the former the attribute is considered apert
from the subject in which it is perceived by tho sensas:
e. g. sight presente to us only albem the mind forms tha
conception albedo. And so Universals are gained by Aa
atramina, i. a. by separating the phenomena in which a giren
group of individuals resemble each other from those in which
they differ. For this reason Loclre calls all universals charact
ideas; a phrase etymologically allowable, but liable to ba
confounded with the scholastic use of the word abstract in a
different sense. For this reason it is better to adhere to the
r term universate: which has at the same time the advantage
of leaving the Logician, as such, uncommitted to any meta·
physical hypothesis as to their nature; since the Realist may
interpretUniversal Sabatenem, the NominalistUniversal Names,
the Conceptualist, Universal Notiora.

The forming universal notions by virtue of the features
thus separated is called by some modern writers Generalization,
