CAP. V.
De Sylloyismo quoad Materiam.

ξ. l. Hac de Syllogismo quoad Formam spec-
tato. , J am de eodem quoad Materiam, h. c. Certi-
tadiaem et Evideatiam propositionum ex quibus
componitur.

Certa autem propositio est, cui nihil occunit
in contrarium, vel quod occurrit instar nihili est;
ut, Omnis bomo est risibilis⁸r Eridane, quae simul

‘This definition is vague enough: the example, however,
shews more clearly what is intended. Foi risibile was regarded
as a property, flowing from, and demonstrable by, the dif-
ferentia ratioaabe. We may therefore define a certain pro· ,,
position as “a proposition capable of demonstration.” It
will thus be distinguished from an avidam proposition, which
is axiomatis and indemonstrable. Both are, of course,
arrasam, which is essential to demonstrative reasoning:
butthe formeris the conclusion of a demonstration; the
latter, a promise. Waiving the physical question cs the
necessary connectiones animality and rationality, we may
give as examples of a certain proposition, “The angles of
every triangle are equel to two right angles ;'' of an evident‚

“Things which ara equel to the same are equal to each
other.'’

Such seems clearly to be Aldrich's meaning in the present
passage; in which carta and avidam correspond to what are
commonly called imamdiata imairdietate aabjeai and imairdiata
immediatam cauea. (Of. Sanderson, lib. 3. cap. 12. from whom
this part is chiefly taken.) Aldrioh's subsequent language,
however, is by no means consistent.
