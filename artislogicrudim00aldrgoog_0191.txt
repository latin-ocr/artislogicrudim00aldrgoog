We have next to consider the Definitions of Sub-
stances Here too the investigationes cause is the root
61 the whole inquiry3 but the manner in which it is oon-
dueted is not at first sight so obvious as in the former
case. To 661( the cause (1166 attribute, is to ask why
the subject is so all'ected. Why, 161 example, is the moon
eclipsed? But what is meant by the conse of a man, and
in what form will the question be proposed? To ask
why man existe, is in fact to ask why there are such
beings in the world-a question admitting only of Gran-
gousier's solutione—and when so solved, contributing
nothing towards the Definition. To ask why a man is 6
man, is, as Aristotle himself observes, fittilef. The only
form in which the question can 116 put is, Why is this or
that individual a man? What are the essentia] con-
stituents 61 the notion Man, the possession ο1 which
entitles Socrates to be rechoned in the class? Here too
the formal cause determines the Definition.

These Definitions form the first (11 the three kinds dis-
tinguished in Anal. Post. ii. 10. 4. Ἔστιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς dg

μὲν λόγος τοῦ τί ἔστιν ἀναπόδεικτος. These Definitions ,are

assumed prior to all demonstratione and are real, in-
asmuoh as the existence 61 the objeots is assumed with
them. The ground 61 the assumption will vary according
to the nature (11 the object to be definedt.

With regard to the third class 61 definitions, described
as τῆς τοῦ τί ἐστιν ἀποδείξεως συμπέρασμα, Commentators

to support this interpretation requires considerable straining of Aristotle's
language.
