only of its members can be true. And Aquinas maintains
that any disjunctive proposition in which this condition is
not observed, is false. On this supposition all the four infer-
ences given by Aldrich are valid. But it may be questioned
whether the incompatibility of the members appears in the
form of every disjunctive proposition. We moy hoppen to know
that two altematives cannot be true together, so that the-
affirmation of the second necessitates the denial of the first,
and the affirmation of the first the deniel of the second;
but this, as Boethius observes is a material, not aformal
consequence, whether it be stated in the hypotheticel or dis-
junctive form. It must be ellowed that the examples some
times adduced on this side of the question have not been very·
happily chosen. It sounds oddly enough to stete a known
truth as a possible falsehood‚ as in the instance, “Bellum
Trejcaum cecinit eel Homerus vel Virpc'lius.'' But other and
more naturel specimens have been given; e. g. “Aet olim
Trcja fuit, eut historic de bello Trojano est mere fabule.’'
The case is still clearer when both members of the dis·
, junctive are negative, as in the example given by Boethius,
“ si enim quis dieat, aut non est album aut non est nigrum,
sive elbum non esse assumpserit, non necesse erit esse vel
non esse nigrum; sive nigrum non esse assumpserit, ut sit
vel non sit album, nullam faciet necessitatem.'’ On this
supposition only two of the above syllogisms are valid which
may be reduced to hypotheticals as follows:

Constructive. Destructive.
IfAis not B, G is D. IfAis not Β, G is D.
But A is not B. But 0 is not D.
