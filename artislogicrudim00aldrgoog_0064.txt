the use of privative and indefinite terms, and approves of
division by contraries. (See Top. vi. 6. 3. de Part. Anim. i. 3.)
Here dichotomy is only practicable when the contraries admit

ι no medium between thern. (11011.10,18.Τορ.ν1.6.1.

Examples of dichotomy by contraries may be found in the
Arbor Porphyriana. For a threefold division of the same kind,
see Eth. Nic. vii. 6, 5. τῶνγὰρ ἡδέων ἔνια φύσει αἱρετά, τὰ δ’ ἐναντία
νώτων, τὰ δὲ μεταξύ. Dichotomy by contradiction, which Aristotle
censuras, had been a favourite method with Plato, as it efter·
warde was with Romus and his followers. See Hamilton's
Reid, p. 689. of. Trend. Elem. t. 68. Eriduterungen, p. 106.

But regarding Logia as a formal science, dichotomy by
contradiction alone can have place in it. In any other
division, knowledge of the muner oi a conception is required.
And even in thie, we do not know a priori that both members
oi the contradiction are included within the sphera of the
conception, but only that one or both must be. Oi. Kant, Logik.

iEccipit. The reason of this order is given by Abelard:
“Quoniam vero divisiones definitionibus naturaliter priores
sunt, quippe ex ipsis constitutionis suae originem ducunt, in
ipso quoque tractatu divisiones merito priorem locum obtine·
bunt, definitiones vero posteriorem.’' Dialectica ed. cousin.
p. tto. This order, however, is not uniformly observed by
Logiciens.
