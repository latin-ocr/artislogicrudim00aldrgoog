the sun's light is intercepted by the earth. What is
an eclipse? An intercepting of the sun‘s light from the
moon hythe earth. Thunder in the same way is defined,
‘anteana σοςὸςῖν νέφει, the answer to the question διὰ τι
figaria being διὰτὸ ἀποσβέννυσθαι τὸ σῦς ἐν τῷ ripa.

This kind of definition, as has been observed‚ differs
from a demonstration in the position (θέσις) of its
terms1'3 for it has the same terms (ἔκλειψις, οἰντίφςαξις,
σελήνῃ-βροντή, ἀιόσβοσις σορός, νέφος) but not in the same
order, and with some variety of grammatical form (πτῶσις ι). ¹

The Definition, then, of an Attribute is to be found in
its (lause. But the Aristotelian Philosophy recognises
four Causea, and sometimes mere than one of these is
concemed in the productiones the same effect. Which
of these is to be taken as the Definition? In Anal. Post.
ii. 11. Aristotle shews that any one of the four may be
used asa middle term in demonstration3 but it by no
means follows that each may be a Definition of the major
term. On this point, Aristotle’s opinion is not decidedly

“ Omne corpus illuminatum ab alio, inter quod et corpus illuminans opacum
corpus sic interponitur, ut umbra opaci corporis operiat et comprehendat
corpus illuminatum, eclipsatur seu privatur suo lumine.”

i The Definitionis by some given as “an obscuration of light in the
moon, caused hy the interposition of the earth.” But in this ease, the
major term of the Demonstrative Syllogism is not “eclipsed‚” but “ oh-
scured.'' If these two terms are synonymus, the Definitionis merely
nominal, and the latter part superfluous3 ifnot‚ we do not define the
attribute demonstrated (obscuration),hut another,(eclipe),contained under
itas species under genus. I interpret Aristotle‘s words as referring ιο tha
complex form of the Definition, as given in question and answer, or in apro·
position-‘sl ἐστιν ἔκλειψιις ἀντίφραξις ὕπο γῆς· ἡ ἔκλειψις ἐστιν &ariopagus
ὑπογῆς. So the thirdform os Definitionmentioned An. Pnii. 10. resembles
the conclusion os a Demonstration, as containing, in the same form, only
¹the may'or and minor tarms, (βροντή, νέφος) ἡβροντή ἐστι ψόφος ἐν νέφει.
Aristotle's textis not decisive, the one view being rather supported by
ch. 8. the other hy ch. 10. The question is by no means unimportana the
attempt ιο reduce these Definitions ιο a pseudo-Genus and Differentia has
fostered a grave error, which will be notieed hereafter.

¹¹ Pacius and Waitz consider πτῶσις and θέσις ιο be synonymous
