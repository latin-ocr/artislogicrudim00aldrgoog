from the conclusion, wc find that the major contains the
minor, the minor the middle, the middle the major3 so that,
in fact, the major contains itself.

The fourth figure has been defended by Lambert, who
declares it to be useful for the discovery 01 exclusion of the
species of a genus. He frames a principle for it, called dictam
dc reciproco. I. If no M is B, no B is this or that M (Ga-
menes). H. If (1 is 01 is not this or that B, there are B's
which are 01 010 not 0. (Bramantip, Dimaris, Fesapo, Fresison.)
The principle is sufficiently clumsy ; the utility questionable.
For the syllogism is not an instrument ol discovery; and how
can we proce the species of a genus hy a particular conclusion?
“Some B is Ο,” only proves a separabtc accident. It may be
observed also, that the objection which Lambert urges and
with reason, against the conversion of the second and third
figures, viz. that by conversion we often substitute an un·
natural and indirect for 0 natural and direct predication, does
not hold as regards the fourth. For, in the first three moods
nc conversicn of premises is needed. By regarding the first
stated as the minor, the second as the major, we obtain a
much more natural conclusion in the first figure. Fesapo
and Fresison establish acceptione, and therefore, on Lambert's ’
theory, should more naturally fall into the third figure.
