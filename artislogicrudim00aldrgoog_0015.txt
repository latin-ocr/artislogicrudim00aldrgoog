work has all the appearance ofa mere compssation
from previous authorities ‘¹, it may be regarded as
fumishing the earliest evidence conoeming these
remarkable specimens of ingenuity. ¹

of my own very imperfect acquaintance with the
post-Aristotelian Logicianrr, Ι am well aware. But
when the alternative lies between the postponement
of the present work to an almost indefinite period,
and the attempting it from such resources as I can
at present command, the necessity that has long
been felt for something of the kind, will,I trust,
· be allowed as some apology for the deficiencies of
the execution.

One other point remains to be noticed. ln com-
menting, whether for explanation or correction, on
the language of a manual so brief as that of Aldrich‚
there is no tutor but must have felt the difficulty
of attaining the happy medium between dogmatic
assumption on the one hand and prolix discussion
on the other. It is possible so to bewilder a pupil
’ with promises that he shall utterly lose sight of the
conclusi0n; it is possible so to overwhelm him with
assertion, as to leave him no choice but that of
blind submission to the ipse dicit of his tutor or
the ipse scripsit of his text-book. The same

‘¹ live treatises out of the seven composiug the Summoloe
are little more than a translation from the Greek of Michael
Psollus. In the latter work, however, the mnemonics do not
⁰ appear, with the exception of one for the opposition of modals‚
(δουλούμεναι, thuidos, παρνασίου, ἔκτρέχουσι,) corresponding to the
Purpureo, Iliaco, Arnabimas, Edentnli, of the Latin Logicians.
