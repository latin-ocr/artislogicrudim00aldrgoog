proprie Syllogismus est Adversarium redarguens:
confirmando scil. quod illius sententiae contradicat.
Quare in hanc incidit Fallaciam qui se putat
Adversarium redarguere, non servatis Contradiccndi

· 1101 logically follow 11010 the premises; or when the promises

themselves are not admitted hythe opponent; 01 when the
conclusion, though legitimately deduced from allowed pre·
mises, isan apparent, not 0 1001, contradiction 01 1110 op·
ponent‘s position, failing in 0110 01 the four conditions of
contradiction, viz. codem 010010, secundum 111010, od 111001, codam
tenpore. In this extended sense, every fallacy is an Ignoratio
Elenchi‚ as is observed by Aristode, Soph. Elench. 6. 1.

though the name is especially applied 10 1110 last instance.

¹ This fallacy‚ according 10 Aristotle, most frequently occurs
in the deductio cd impossibile, and consists in pretending that 1110
proposition which we wish to 101010 10 the cause 01 the 10100
conclusion, which in reality follows 110111 other premises;

i. e. in maintaining that the conclusion is 10100 because 1101
particular assumption is false. This mode 01 deception has
place in dialectical disputation‚ from the practice of asking
the opponent 10 grant certain promises. An unnecessary
proposition is asked and granted among the rest, and after·
wards selected as the 10100 assumption. Aldrich's examples
refer rather 10 1110 rhetorical than 10 1110 dialectical form 01
this fallacy. In this the speaker is guilty merely of 010100
0000111011, attributing a certain effect 10 0 wrong cause. See
Rhet. ii. 24. 8.

¹²¹ In the 000 cero pro cera, there is no connexion between
the effect and the supposed cause; in the non 1011 pro 1011,
there is a connexion but 011 insufficient one; wine, 0. g. does
