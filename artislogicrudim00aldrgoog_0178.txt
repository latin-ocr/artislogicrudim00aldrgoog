may take the scholastic language as he finds it, and
explain it with reference to the theorias on which it
was originally founded3 waming, however, attha same
time his readers or haerere, that the supposed real
essences are deserving of the same amount of belief as the
Deities of Heathen Mythology, or the Sylphs, Gnomes,
and Salamanders of the Rosicrucians: or he may
adopt a theory of Universals in conformity with views
current in modern philosophy, and remodel the whole
account 0f the predicables, so as to make it consistent

important particulars will fail entirely, and the excepÎ‡
tional cases must either by some unnatural distortion be
forced under the. given classification, or be excluded
altogether, to the serious detriment of the completeness
of the. theory.

To adopt then the first mode of explanation. We will
suppose that Genera and Species are substances, having
a real existence independently of us, and cognisable as
to their nature, no matter how, by the human mind. Of
these universal substances, some are more. extensive,
others less so, the limita at both extremities being fixed
by nature, and the numbers in each degree settled and
unalterable. The higher enter into the composition of
the lower, the lowest not contributing to form any other
Universal,but susceptible of Accidents,.from which union
are formed various individuals. Man, for example, is a
