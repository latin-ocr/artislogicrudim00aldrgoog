promise may fairly be regarded as per se: the subject

forming part of the definition of the predicate. For
Equality, in the limited sense in which it is employed
in Geometry, is a property of Magnitudes3 and the
latter, as the first and proper subject, will appear in
the definiticn cf Geometrioal Equality. This definition ·
has been found by some Geometers in the eighth axiom
of Euclid; “ Magnitudes which coincide are equal;'’
which, stated in the Aristotelian form, would be,
“ Equality is the Coinoidence of Magnitudes.'’

The minor promise may also be considered as per se.

For our definition oi a right angle is, that it is half the
sum of the two adjacent angles formed by one straight

line with anothe13 and our notion of two right angles ic,
that of the sum of the same two adJ'acent angles. As
regards the Conclusion, we need not trouble ourselves
with reducing it to the requisite conditions, inasmuch as
it is expressly said by Aristode to comply with them.
This compliance does not directly appear in the only
form- in which the proposition can be syllogistically
proved3 but in the equipollent statement, that the
triangle is a figure of which the interior angles ere equal
to two right angles. The predicate in this case states a
property of the triangle, in the definition oi which
property, if any be attempted, the proper subject must
he included.

A demonstration of this kind certainly falls short, in
some respects, of the scholastic model. The predicate
and subject in each proposition, os stated, are not con-
vertible; and the middle term is not a definition of the
minor. But of these requisitions, the first seems to be
founded on an erronecus interpretation of Aristotle,
according to which that Philosopher is supposed to
speak of the Propositions as they appear when strictly
enunciated in logical form ; not (as seems moro prohnblc)
