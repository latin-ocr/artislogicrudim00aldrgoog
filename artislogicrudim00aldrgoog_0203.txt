ON MATERIAL AND FORMAL CONSEQUENCE. ⁸

A Marcum consequence is defined by Aldrich to bc
one in which the conclusion follows from the premises
solely by the force of the terme. This in fact means,
from some understood Proposition or Propositions, con-
necting the terma, by the addition of which the mind is
enabled to reduce the Consequeuce to logical form. This
is easily seen, both in Aldrich’s example, “Homo est
animal, Ergo est vivens,'’ and in the rather more com·
plicated instance given by Sandemon, “Socrates est
risibilis, ergo, Aliquis homo θεῖ rationalis.'‘ The latter,
when the necessary conditione are supplied, is expanded
into two syllogisms.

Omne risibile est rationale;
Socrates cst risibilis,

Erg0, Socrates θεῖ rationalis.
Socrates θεῖ homo,

Ergo, Aliquis homo est rationalis.

The failure therefore of a Material Consequence takes ·
place when no such connection exista between the terms
as will warrant us in supplying the premises required:
i. e. when one or more of the premises so supplied would
be false. But to determine this point is obviously
beyond the province of the Logician. For this reason,
Material Consequence is rightly excluded from Logic.
Moreover, even where true premises can be added,
and the Consequence legitimately deduced, we cannot, Α
except from knowledge of the matter, determine into
what form the reasoning will naturally fall. In some
cases, as in the example above quoted from Sandcrson‚
