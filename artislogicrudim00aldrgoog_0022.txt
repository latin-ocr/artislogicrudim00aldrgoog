and Definition¹. Both of these he exhibited in the
dialectio form. His induction, however, more nearly
· resembles the example of Aristotle than the induction
properly so called. It consisted in submitting to his

, adversary a number of cases similar to the one which

he desired to prove ; and having gained his consent to
these, he inserted in an interrogative form his own
conclusion. As a specimen, may be taken the following

argument from the Gorgias ΣΩ. T! odv3 irai τεκτονικὰ
μεμαθηκώς τεκτονικός, ἢ οὕ; ΓΟΡ. Nat. ΣΩ. Οὐκοῦν καὶ irai

μουσικοὶ μουσικός ; ΓΟΡ. Nat. ΣΩ. Kal tra ἰατρικαὶ ἰατρικός

καὶ τᾶλλα οὕτω κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον· ὁ μεμαθηκώς ’ἕκαστα

τοιοῦτός ἐστιν οἷον ἡέπιστῆμη ἕκαστον ἀπεργάζεται; ΓΟΡ. Πάνυ ’

This argument possessas both the characteristica which
distinguish example from induction. It does not profess
to give a complete enumeration of individual instanees‚
and it appends to the general conclusion a deductive rea·
, soning to an additional one. Such reasoning has no place
inLogio properly so called. Thatsciencereoognisesno ,
inference that is not necessitated by the laws of thought3
whereas in instanoes like the above it is obvious that the
premises may be true, and yet the conclusion faisen. Or

’ · two specimens may be found both oomplying with the

above form, one of which shall carry conviction to every
reasonable man, while the other is utterly worthless. Its .
moral force, then, may vary “from the highest moral
certainty to the very lowest presumption¹.'’ Its loyieal

value is—zero.
