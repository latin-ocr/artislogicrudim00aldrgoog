Α few words in conclusion on the. origin of the name
Enthymeme. That its etymology is to be found in ἓν
and θυμὸς, isundeniable3 but only in the same degree as
is also true of ἐνθυμεῖσθαι, ἐνθύμιος, and other cognate terms.
But that it has no special reference to a premise io the
mind, is evident3 firstly, because θυμὸς in the Aristotelian
phraseology is not “the mind,'’ and has nothing to do
with the expression or suppression of premises3 secondly,
because the word ἐνθύμημα occurs in writers earlier than
Aristotle, and before it could have assumed its technical
meaning. To ascertain the true derivation, however, is
not so easy as to refuto a palpably absurd' one. lf,
however, we were compelled to make a suggestion, the
following, though not confidently put forward, has at
least the merit of not ‘being positively ridiculous.
Ἔνθύμημα seems originally to have signified an object
of consideration, ora matter proposed as worth oon-
sidering. Such is the leading idea in the two passages
of Sophocles in which it occurs. “Your words, duty
considered, are calculated to inspire fear³.” “Your own
misfortnnes‚ properly weiybed, rnay teach the evil results
of a violent temper ⁰.'’ The transition from this to an
. argument os probability, a suggestion, though not demon-
strative, yet deserving attention in practica] questions-is
easy and natural enough.
