“ in speciem.” Boethius de divisione. This, as well as the
communis and discretiva, may be understood absolutely or
relaticely. Porphyry recognises only a relative differentia
between ravo alcen mcccc. Thus remacle is not the differentia
oi man per se, but of man as distinguished from brutas.
Hence he defines man, ζῷον λογικὸν θνητόν ; the last term being
in like manner the differentia of man, as compared with the
gode. In this he is supported bytho bascat writings of
Aristotle. The theory oi a single differentia coextensive with its
subject, and distinguishing it lrom all other species whatever, is
perhaps implied in the Metaphysics (vi. 12.); though, as the
passage is usually interpreted, it is not easy to reconcile
Aristotle's theory with his practice. From this passage, how·
ever, as explained (rightly or wrongly) by the Arabiane, the
doctrine passed to Albert and Aquinas, and became acanon
of the scholastic Logic. It cannot, however, be consistently
maintained by any but a Realist. See Appendix, note A.
