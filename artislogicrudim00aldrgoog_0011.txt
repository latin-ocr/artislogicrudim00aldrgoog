niably is in many of the prominent features of the
Scholastic Logia, its very deficiencies render it in
some respects preferable to a more faithful expo-
nent. The criticism of the present age has con-
tributed much towards a more just appreciation of
the merits of the mediaeval Philosophy; but he
must be a bold champion of reaction who would
advocate the complete disinterment of the Logic
of the Schools Who would desire now to oppress
the Student with the heavy burden of modals⁸, or
to bewilder him with the mysteries of Suppositio,

⁸ I would not, however, be understood as advocating the
absolute exclusion of modality from the domain of Logia.
sir W. Hamilton's remarks are indeed conclusive with
⁴ regard to that stupendous absurdity, the determination of
the quantity of an indefinite Proposition from matter trader-
stood, and to be supplied by the Logician. But they are not
applicable to the only modality acknowledged by Aristode,—
amodality expresses} in aProposition‚ and necessitating, under
certain conditione, a corresponding modification of its im·
mediate or mediate consequents. In this respect, modality
stands on precisely the same footing as truth and falsehood.
Itis beyond tho province of the Logician to decide whether
any given proposition is per sc true or false, necessary or
contingent. But to determine under what conditions neces·
sity in a conclusion follows from an assumed necessity in a
premise‚ is as purely Logical as the canon, that the nuth of a
conclusion follows from the assumed truth of its premises‚ or
the falsehood of a premise from the assumed falsehood of the
conclusion. The same may be said of the inferences of eon-
version and opposition. But it does not follow that modals,
though scientifically admissible‚ are wholesome food for the
tyro in Logia, any more than they were of old for the animal
whose fastidiousness is commemorated in the scholastic saying,
de modali aon perstabit osiam
