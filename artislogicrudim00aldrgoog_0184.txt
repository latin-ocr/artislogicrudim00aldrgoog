merely that certain objeots possess certain attributes,
but that they alone possess them. “All equilateral tri·
angles are equiangular,’' may be a proposition of this
class “All men are capable oi understanding language,'’
croy be another. I say may be, because we cannot, from
the mere foryn of the expression, determine whether a
given Proposition is one of Property or Accident, so
long as we use the same sign for the copula in both.
For we are always at liberty to state a portion of the
truth only; and sometimes aportion is all that we are
on a particular occasion warranted in stating. A peculiar
attribute will thus be enunciated merely as an attribute.
The fifth Proposition of Euclid‚ for example, only author·
izes us to state that all equilateral triangles are equi·
angular3 and the sixth, that all equiangular triangles
¹ are equilateral. But when both these have been proved,
we may combine the results into a single statement; and
to avoid the ambiguity of the copula, we may substitute
the symbol of equality,¹ “ All equilateral triangles = equi-
angular‚‘' or quantity the predicate by an universal sign,
as, “All equilateral triangles are all equiangularr.”

In the foregoing remarks, Genus and Definition ex·
press a relation oi notions to notions, Property and
Accident oi attributes to things Hence it will follow,
that notioris purely imaginary, i. e. confessedly prcdicable
of no objects existing elsewhere than in the mind, can
only, as such, be the subjects oi analytical judgments
Proper names on the other hand, having no essenoe, can
only be the subjecte of synthetical judgments The
former have no Properties or Accidents3 the latter have
no Genus or Definition.

r The former is recommended by the Author ol the “ Outline 01* the
Laws of Thought‚” p. 67. I object to it only as aconcession to that
Mathematical method of exposition of which Mr. De Morgan's Logia is the
full development ; amethod alike injurious to the science and repulsive to

the learner.
