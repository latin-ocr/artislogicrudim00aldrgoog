¹ON ARISTOLE'S HYPOTHETIOAL SYLLOGISMS.

, ΤΗΑΤ the συλλογισμοὶ ἔξ ὑποθέσεως of Aristotle are not
⁴ identical with those which, since the time of Theophrastus

. and Eudemus, have been received in Logic as Hypothe-

tical Syllogisms, is now generally admitted ⁵. The word·
Hypothetical is never by Aristotle opposed to Cate-
gorical, but to ostensive (carneaden and he remarks that
the Sylloyistic portion of the reasoning in Hypothetical

Syllogisms is ostensive, and requires no reduction3 but
’ that the determination of the original question is not
affected hy Syllogism at all, and cannot be exhibited in
syllogistic form. The meaning of this may bc clearly
explained by examples.

Of the Hypothetical Syllogism, two principal kinds are
mentioned by Aristotle. One is the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ attiae:
the otherisaSyllogism ofwhiohthe conclusiveness depende
entirely on agreement between two contending partica,
and which is therefore chiefly serviceable in dialectic
disputation. The latter may be exhibited as follows.

The original question being to prove that some A is
not B3 the contending parties agree to the hypothesis,
that if some A is not 0, it is not B. The reasoning
proceeds thus:

No X is O;
All X is A; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)
Theresore‚ Some A is not Ο.

And then, iu consequence of tlte previous agreement, but

³ We must except M. St. Hilaire, who professes to ffisoovcr the ordinary

Hypotheticals in Auel. Prior, i. 44. l. But the text os Aristotle will hardly
warrant the assertion. ’
