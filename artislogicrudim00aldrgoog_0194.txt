the Definition must in every case be a Species. Summa
Genera end Individuals are in that case alone inde-¹
finable. Andior this limitation, the authority of Aristotle
may be cited. On the other hand, Locheb assures us
that this restrictiori is erroneous, and that Simple Idccs
alone are incapable oi Definition0. The disputa may be
reduced to amere verbal question. For Aristotle does
not maintain that all Definitions must be by Genus and
Differentia, but only those of Substnnces In the pas·
seges which seem to extend this mle, Definition is used
in the narrow sense which has been previously men·
tionedd. For it is obvious, to take the instances adduced
above, that “ quenching” cannot be called the genus of
“ thunder,'' or “interception'' oi “ eclipse,” in the same

b Esscy, b. iii. 4. ⁷. But Locha has in this matter been anticipcted by
Desccrtes, Princip. i. 10. Sir W. Hamiltcn (Reid’s Works, p. 220.) main·
tains that Aristode has said the same thing. Itis dangerous to dispute
any thing which a men of Sir William’s learning professes to have dis-
covered in so wide a field cs Aristode, especially as he gives no references3
but ifthe passage alluded to be Metcph. vi. 17. 7. one might bc tempted to
hazard a different interpretation. Τὰ ἁπλᾶ seem rather to be the elements,
(ἁπλᾶ σώματα, Met. vii, 1. 2,.) which have not, like compound substantes,
received a definite form, and thus are not definablc. But 'the words are not
sufficiently decisivo to furnish much ground for any theory. A more remark-
ahlc passage occurs in Occam's Logic, Pt. ich. 23. “ Ex predictis sequitur
quod nulla intentio quac est precise communis rebus simplicibus carentibus
compositione er materia et forma habet differentias essentiales3 quia non
habet parteS, quemvis possit habere multas differentias accidentales Ex
illo sequitur ulterius quod nulla species quae est precise simplicium est
definibilis definitione proprie dicta, sive sit in genere substantiae sivein
quocunqne alio predicamento.” This, coupled with Occam's Conceptualist
theory oi Universala is not very different irom Locke’s position concerning
Simple Idcas.

⁶ By Simple Ideas, Locke meent cll ideas derived immediately from
sensation or reflection. In the formation of these the mind is wholly
passive,whereas in the formation from them of Complex Ideas,it is active.
Among Simple Ideas derived from sensatior, he enumerates solidity,
space, figure, rest, and motion ; from reflection, perception and volition;
from both, plecsure and pain.

and Alex. in Meteph. p. 442. 30. ed. Bonitz.
