ΟΝ THE DEMONSTRATIVE succursu.

'Scrnnrnuc knowledge (τό relevantes), except when of
axiomatio principles·‚ requires a conviction of the neccs-
*sity of the proposition known, and a knowledge cf its
cause ⁵. This is produced by the Demonstrative or
Scientifio Syllogism‚ which, according to Aristotle’s
definition, is ἔξ ἀληθῶν καὶ πρώτων καὶ ἀμέσων καὶ γςωριμω-

’rigon καὶ προτέρων καὶ αἰτίων τοῦ supersedemus& As the

conclusione of this Syllogism are necessary, so must
also be the premises3 this necessity consists in their
being per se, in either the first or the second sense of
that expressionl. If any of these conditions are not
eomplied with; eg. if the premise‚ though containing

ἱ In the strict sense of tho terms, ἐπίστασθαι is said of necessary truths
which we receive hy deduction from higher truths3 νοεῖν, of those which we
receive as evident cf themselves. Hence tho principal meaning of the
conesponding terma ἐπιστήμη and νοῦς. 'I'he latter, however, or rather its

given. 1. When the predicate is port of the definition of the subject
Ω. When the subject is part of the definition of tho predicate. 3. When
existence is predioated of asubstanee. 4. When tho subject is tho external
efficient cause of the predicate. Propositions in Demonstrationpropor
