⁸ Μέθοδος in Aristotle is employed, with various shades of
meaning; 1. for any instrument of acquiring or communicating
knowledge; as in de An. i. 1.4. πότερον ἀπόδειξίς τίς ἐστιν ἢ διαί-
ρεσις ἢ καί τις ἄλλη μέθοδος. Of. Philoponus, Scholia, p. 235, a. 10.
2. for knowledge reduced to system ; and thus as equivalent
to ἐπιστήμηε Phys. Ausc. i. 1. 1. Eth. Nic. i. 1. l. Top. i. 2. 2.
3. sor a systematic treatise on any branch of knowledge,
synonymous with πραγματείαε Polit. iv. 2. l. vi. 2. 6. Eth. Nic.
i. 2. 9. But method is not treated of by Aristotle in any of his
logical writings ; and with reason, for the subject, except so
far as method is synonymous with inference, is extra-logical.

b Method has been treated of by Logicians in two principa]
sensas. 1. As aprocess of inference from the known to the
unknown; which is the earlier sense of the term, and sanc-
tioned by Aristotle and his Greek interpretem. 2. As an
arrangement of truths already known, with a view os com-
municating them to others. The last corresponds to the
Greek τάξις, and should rather be called Ordo. Itis distin-
guished from the first by Zabarella and others. Aldrich's
definition corresponds only to the second sense of Metlarius,-
but in his Subsequent division he confounds it with the first.

⁰ The Methodus laetationis can only be aprocess of inference ; ’
for no aucupantem os parts is possible before they have been
discovered. The diocorum os general principles from individual
