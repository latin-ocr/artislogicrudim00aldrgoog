ln the first place, it is manifestly necessary to a
Petitio Quacum, as the fallacy may more correctly be
called, that there should be a question proposed for
procffl And hence it was long ago acutely remarked by
Peter of Spain, that such a fallacy cannot be committed
in a Syllogism of infer-erices If, that is, the truth of the
premises is known beforehand, and the only question is,
what may we infer from them? there is no necessity for
beppiaq or assumption of any kind. Itis clear then, that
not the Syllogism in general, but at most only one
particular application of it, can beg the question. Ι

But it may be answered‚ that the truth of such pre-
misesnevercan beascertained‚butbyapreviousinduction
embracing all particular cases, and that Syllogistic
inference is therefore at least futile, since the con-
clusion drawn must be presumed to be already known.
But this answer itself assumes what has never yet been
satisfactorily proved, the dependence of all knowledge of
Universals on Induction. If axiomatic principles can be
acquired in any other way, one class of Syllogisms is at
least exempt from the charge 0.

And even in respect of principles allowed to be in·
ductive, the actual previous assumption of every possible
instance is not necessarily implied. And it is here that
an able defendor of the Syllogism‚ Mr. Mill, has taken a
low and inadequate ground, a ground tce, inconsistent
with his own subsequent analysis of the process of
Induction. His defence in fact amounts to an abandon-

θ Kant's criterion of necessity as the sure characteristic of acognition
a priori, has not yet been refuted by those who refer all principles to
Induction.
