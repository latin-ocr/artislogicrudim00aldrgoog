Το determine under what conditione such a 0001101100
000 110 obtained, is a question requiring an analysis of
the whole process 01 Induction. Such an analysis, in

many 10000010 10001 ably performed ⁸, will 110 found in the
third book 01 Μ1. Mill's Logic3 1101 few I think can

compare that part 01 the work with his earlier defenee of
the Syllogism, without admitting that the two presuppose
different and inconsistent theories 01 the import of
Universal Propositions 111111111000111010111,110110101,101
my present purpose to observa 11101, 001000 the establish-
1000101οη Universa] Proposition requires an explicit
and conscious examination 01 every existing and also 01
every possible particular instance, no charge 01 Petitio
Principii, 01 0100 01 1010 repetition, can be maintained
against the Syllogism. These who maintain 1110 antece·
dent, abendon themselves toan absolute scepticism; and

parte, sola inductione nunquam perfecte sciemus. Mox enim prodibit, qui
negabit ob peculiarem quandam rationem in aliis nondum 10010110 veram
esse.” Leibnitz‚ de Stylo Nizolii.

Μ1. Mill’s adminiculo 1010110011οο are certain canons stating the prin-
ciples 01 the Method of Agreement‚ 01 Differenee, &a which, together with
the whole 101101 0011010οΙ 0000011011, he makes dependent upon aweaker
evidence than philosophical induction3 110 inductio per enumerationem
simplicem. 01 the same time he enters his protest against “ adducing‚ as
evidence 01 the truth of 0100110 externa] nature, any necessity which the
human mind may be conceived 10 be under of belieu'ng it.'’ His words,
strictly taken, would destroy the evidence 01 00100000ος for 11101010
0000011000 but states of mind? ond why do we refer 001 10101001 conscious-
ness to an external 00000, except that hythe constitution 01 001 minds we
010 necessitated 10 do so? The admonition 01 Hooker is not quite obsoleta
even amid the lights 01 modern philosophy. “The main principles of
Reason 010 10 themselves apparent. For 10 make nothing evident 01110011
10 man's understanding were 10 take away all possibility of knowing any
thing. And herein 11101 of Theophrastus is true, ‘ They that seek 0 reason
01 all things do utterly overthrow Reason.”' Eccl. Pol. i. 8. 0.

s His theory 01 1100001100 10001 however he exeepted.
