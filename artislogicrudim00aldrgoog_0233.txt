own example being taken hom Geometry. But still its
connexion with the original question is not formal, but

material; for we assume,
All A is B;

All Ο is A;
Therefore, All Ο is B.
And this conclusion, from material grounds, we know to
be false. We also know (materially again) that the minor
promise is truc; and all that is logical in the process is
the consequent decision that the major must be false3
and hence by the principle of contradiction that the
original question is true.

But one step only is wanting, to convert these material
consequences into formal ones. We have in the συλλο-
γισμὸς ἐξ ὁμολογίας clearly the germ oi the Conditional
Syllogisms of Theophrastus. lt needs but to commenoe
with the original hypothesiS, not as a mere dialectic
convention, but as a Proposition having its own objectiva
salue, and we have at once alogical argumentation, not
in categorical form, but equally valid‚ to which the Aris·
totelian specimen is related merely as a prosyllogism
supporting one of the promises. This done, no great
sagacity is required to see that the prosyllogism may in
thie, as in any other case,be omitted or not, according to
the material character oi the premise which it supports.

To the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς abactam may in like manner be
traced the origin of the Disjunctive Syllogism. The
most natural proceeding in this case is to state the two
contradictory Propositions as Alternatives, one of them
being disproved by a prosyllogism.

All O is A;

Therefore All (l is B.
