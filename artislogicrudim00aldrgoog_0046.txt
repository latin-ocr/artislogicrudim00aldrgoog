γεγραμμένον. Συνὼνυμο δὲ λέγεται ὧν τό τε ὄνομα κοινὸν καὶ ὁ κατὰ

(Oat. ch. 1.) Analogous nouns are but one out of many
species of equivocal, belonging to the equivoco coasilio, (ἀπὸ
διανοίας,) of the Greek interpreters; to which are opposed the
equivoco coac, (ἀπὸ τύχης.) See Scholia, p. 42, a. 37, 47.
Boethius in Praedicamenta, lib. 1. p. 117. (Of. Arist. Eth. Nic.
i. 4. 12.) The συνώνυμα of Aristotle must be distinguished from
the modern synonyms, which answer to the πολυώννμο of
Speusippus (Schol. p. 43, a. 31.) and the multivoca of Boethius,
and are defined by the latter, “quorum plura nomina, una
definitio est.” Συνώννμα was used in this sense hythe Stoica,
and the same sense may also be found in Aristotle, Rhet. iii.
2. 7. and perhaps Top. viii. 13. 2.

r It is not easy to distinguish accurately the two divisione
of terms into absolute and connotative‚ abstract and con-

crete, respectively. The following attempt is made with some Ἴ

doubt as to its success. In the second chapter of the
Gategories‚ Aristotle divides all ὄντα into four classes, Uni·
versal Substances‚ Singular Substancea Universal Attributea
and Singular Attributes. Substances of both kinds exist per
sc; attributes can only exist in substantes. Hence the
scholastic distinction between Subjects of Predication and
Subjects of Inhesion. The universal substances are pre-
dicable of the singular, as genera and species of individuals.
“Socrates is a man.” In this case the individualis a subject
ol predication, Attributes arc not in their original state
predicable of substances Whiteness exists in snow; but we
cannot say, “ Snow is whiteness” Here, then, the subject is
not one of predication, but of iabcsioa. But, ογ an act of the
mind, an attribute may be so connected with a subject as to
