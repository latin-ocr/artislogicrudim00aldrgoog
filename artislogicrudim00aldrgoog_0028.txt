extension of Dialeotio is found in the commentaries of
David the Armenian& and Philoponus uses both terma
as synonymous, and in the same extent⁸.

From the above remarks· it will follow, that in the
often-disputed question oonoerning the nature of Logia,
the authority of Aristotle is of no avail on one side or
the other3 sinoe he did not oompose the Organon as one
work, or regard it as treating of one subject. The Dia-
lectio of Aristotle is certainly an Art,- his Analytio, both
implioitly from his mode of treatment, and explioitly
from his own oonsessionh, must he regarded as a Seianae.
But the question, Suntne mel et sel dulcio, is not less
suseeptible of a single aye or no, than the inquiry,
whether the whole Organon of Aristotle treats of an Art
or a Soienoe.

Sir W. Hamilton regards the whole question between
Art and Soienoe as merely verbal¹2 and it certainly is so
thus far, that the advocates of one or the other in theory

have seldom suffered it to make any differenoe in their
practice. But this only proves their own inconsistenoy.
Itis true that if we start from the Organon of Aristotle as
a whole, and presumo the substanoe of Logio to be
already settled, the question whether it shall be oalled

Staius too are known to hare adopted the threefold division ot Philosophy
into Logio, Physies, and Ethios3 indeed the language of Laertius, οὕτω δὲ
’πρῶτος otene Ζήνων, seems to imply that they, and not Plato, were the
original authors of it. Cf. Laert. vii. 39. Plut. de Plao. Phil. i. l. But ss
regards the nature and extent of the Stoioal Logio or Dialeotie, (for with
them the terms were synonymous,) there is considerable uncertainty. See
