This Demonstration is exceedingly satisfactory, if we
are only allowed to assume all the conditions 011 which
its validity depends3 vizi 1. that risibility' does 11011 00
011 effect from rationality as a cause ; 2. that the major
premise, in which this causaticn is asserted, is 011
axiomatis principle, cognoscible o priori, and, as such,
carrying with its cognition, the conviction of necessity;
3. that the conclusion is not 0 mere repetition, in dif-
ferent words, of the major premise; homo and animal
rationale being identica13 4. that any Demonstration
acknowledged to be valid 0011 be resolved into the above
form.

But waiving the consideration 01 these questions,
which are more easily asked than answeredss, 110 may'
⁴ find a simpler way of testing the monstratio potissima,
by going back to the original authority. For Aristotle’s
examples are principally taken, as is natiual, from the
Mathematics3 and it is to a Geometrioal theorem that the
1001001 καθ’ 1111101111 ᾗ αὐτό 010 expressly appliedl. Can-it
be believed, then, that Aristotle regarded the following
00 0 correct analysis of Geometrical Demonstration?

Every rectilineal figure 01 three sides has its angles equal
to two right angles;

Every triangle is erectilineal figure 01 three sides; therefore

Every triangle has its angles equal to two right angles.
