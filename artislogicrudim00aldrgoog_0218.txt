the logical accuracy of his reasoning. ln Dialectic, two
champions are opposed to each other: they may, before
engaging, dictate the conditions of the combat.

As regards the account of the Enthymeme‘in the
- Prior Analytics,l am not aware that any further expla-
nation is neededi. But in the corresponding chaptcrs of
the Rhetorio one or two difficulties romain, an elucida-

tion oi which, though not strictly within my present η

province, may perhaps be serviceable ιο the readers of
the latter Treatise.

In Rhet. i. 2, 18. we are told, that when the Enthymeme
is in the third figure, the σημεῖον is to its conclusion as a
particular ιο an universal. In the second figure, on the
other hand, as an universal ιο a particular. Τ11ο relation
in the first figure is not mentioned, but the context seems
rather ιο connect it with the former than with the latter. -

This passage may be interpreted in two ways. Either
we may compare the conclusion of the Enthymeme
with the σημεῖον itself, or with the major premise of
that Syllogism whose minor is the σημεῖον. In tho former
interpretation the word σημεῖον is used properly for the
proposition ; in the latter widely, for the reasoning of
' which such proposition forms a portion.

If the first interpretation be adopted, (which seems
preferable,) we must compare the two propositione
relatively to that term in which they are unlilre; i. e. if
they have the same subject, we must compare their

ἶ Except perhaps that Aristotle, in Anal. Pr. ii. 27, admits a σημεῖον in
the second figure, which in the former chapter he condemned. The con-
demnation seems to be made on logical grounds. The loptcal value of two
affirmative premises in the second figure is absolute zer03 whereas the
σημεῖον in the third figure, though faulty as employed to prove an universal
conclusion, is valid for particulare. For Rhetorical pmposea however, the
second figure is also admissible: an accumulation of Enthymemes, ull
lopically worthles5‚ may amount to amoral certainty.
