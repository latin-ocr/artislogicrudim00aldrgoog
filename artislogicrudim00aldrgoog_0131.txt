remarks will be found in the Introduction. Its name had
originally reference, not to the probable character of the
matter, but to the colloquial form.

‘¹ The τόποι are general principles of probability, standing in
the same relation to tlie dialectic syllogism as the axioms to
the demonstrative. A definition is given, Rhet. ii. 26. 1. ἔστι
γὰρ στοιχεῖον καὶ τόπος εἷς ὃ πολλὰ ὄνθυμὴματα ἐμπίπτει. The origin
of the name may be illustrated by calling it the place in which
we look foi· middle tem1s; with which may be compared
Cicero's definition, Top. ch. 2. “ Itaque licet definire, locum
esse argumenti sedern: argumentum autern, rationem, quae
rei dubiae faciat fidem.'‘

² The Schoolmen divided Loci into two kinds, which they
called Mutrium, and Differentioe Maximorum. The former were
propositions expressing a general principle of probability, (or
even of certainty, for the term was extended to include axioma 3)
such as, “De quocunque praedicatur definitio, et definitum.”
The latter consisted os one or more words, expressing the
point in which one maxim differed from another; eg. the
above maxim was said to be ea defiuitione et diffinito: so in
Aldrich's example the maxim is, Perua credendum est iu aua
arte ,· the differentia, Testimonium: The latter were sometimes
· called 'simply Loci. Of. Petr. Hisp. Tract. v. The distinction
