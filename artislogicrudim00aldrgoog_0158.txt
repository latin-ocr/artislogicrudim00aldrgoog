Testudine. Quiescente illo, confecerit Testudo
partem aliquam (puta decimam) spatii percurrendi.
Tum procedat Achilles, idemque spatium per-
currat: progredietur interim Testudo per partem
ejus decimam, h. e. totius spatii centesimam; hanc
conficiat Achilles, et percurret interim Testudo
hujus centesimae decimam; et sic deinceps in
infinitum; quo fiet ut Achilles nunquam asse-
quatur Testudinem ¹².

²¹ Arohbishop Whately evades the difficulty of Zeno‘s argu-
ment, by observing‚ that it cannot be exhibited in a Syllogism.
But this confession is in fact a surrender of the syllogistic
criterion, as a means of discriminating between sound and
unsound reasoning. On the contrary, nothing is easier than
to exhibit the reasoning in a Syllogism, and to shew thereby
that the fallacy does not lie in the form, but in the matter.
Thus, representing the whole space to be traversed by a.

“Any space equalto ᾗ) -l- id& -Ι- 1-6-’00 irc. is infinite, (being the
sum of an infinite series). The space to be passed before
Achilles overtakes the tortoise is equal to this sum. There-
fore it is infinite.''

The whole mystery of this famous fallacy lies in this, that
tlte moy'or prembe isfalse. The sum of an infinite series may
be, and in this case ia, finite.

It may be observed‚ that Aldrich is mistalren as regards
Zeno’s object in this Sophiam. It was proposed to support
the leading tenet of Parmenides of the unity of all things by
shewu'ng that the identity of rest and motion isa necessary
result from the contrary opinion. It does not appear, however,

that Zeno advanced this argument seriously. His principa] ·

design was to retort the ridicule which had been thrown on
the doctrine of Parmenides by involving his opponente in
the same absurdities which they professed to find in bis

theory. cf. Plat0, Pann. p. 128. Arist. Soph. Elench. 10. 2.
