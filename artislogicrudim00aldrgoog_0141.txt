Methodus Doctrinae duplex est. “Perfecta ἀκροα-
ματικὴ; et Inperfecta, ἐξωτερική. Perfecta rur-
suS, vel Universolr's est, qua integra disciplina, vel
Particularia, qna aliqua disciplinae pars docetur.
Utraque duplex est.

objects os sense, if limited to the inferential process itself,
will be Inductioa. The term, however, is sometimes extended
so as to include the preliminary accumulation of individuale.
In this wider sense it will embrace the four successive steps
given by Aristode, Anal. Post. ii. 19. αἴσθησις, μνήμη, ἐμπειρία,
ἐπαγωγή.

But the Methodici Inventioais must not be absolutely limited
to Induction and its preliminaries‚ though these are the most
important instruments of discovery. In some sciences as in
mathematice, truths are chiefly discovered by demonstration;
and till so discovered, cannot, of course, be imparted to others
by the methodus doctrina.

Induction and Syllogism are the only two methods of
insererer. The Greek commentators, Ammonius and Eu·
stratiuS, enumerate four, adding Division and Definition; but
in these last there is no reasoning process See Zabarella,
de Methodis lib. iii. cap. t sqq.

‘¹ The Mardocha Doctrina is not in the same sense a process
of inference from known to unknown; for the parts are sup-
posed to be known already to the teacher‚ and are methodically
arranged for the benefit of the ieamer. This then corresponds
rather to Order than to Method in the proper sense. It may
be an arrangement either of the whole or osa portion of a
subject3 and is thus either universal or particular. cf.
Zabarella, de Methodis, lib. ii. cap. 20. The distinction
between the Perfect and Imperfect Method is not usually
recognised by writers on the subject. Aldrich is thinking os
the acroamata and acroteria teaching os Aristotle and others;
the characteristic feature os the latter being the suppression
os certain doctrines as not fitted for a promiscuous audience.
Whereas tha universal and particular Methods merely relate
to the whole and the parts in the same exposition.
