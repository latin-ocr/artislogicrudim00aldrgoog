known constant must always be added to complete the
integration; unfortunately we have no means cf de-
termining its value. still, this does not effect the basis
of the Aristotelian distinction. For some phenomena
can be accounted for by other phenomenal causes3 in
others, we must acquiesce in the conviction that they are
sc, merely because they are. It is clearly impossible
for the mere hypothesis of an unknown substratum to
explain the reason of all the variety of attributes which
different objecta exhibit.

One further question remains. How far Definition
properly belongs to the province of Logic, was, as we
have seen, an early point of disputa among the School·
meum. On this question the authority of Aristotle is of
little avail for either side. That his treatment of the
subject has far more of a material than aformal character
is undeniable. And to those who maintain that the
Organon of Aristotle is designed as a systematic treatise
on a single subject called Logic, such testimony must be
decisive as regards both the material character of much
of the Science, and its inclusion of Definition. But
then it remains‚ and probably will continue to remam,
a problem, to frame a conception of Logic adequate to
the province thus assigned to it. This question has been
already treated of in the Introduction, and need not be
repeated here. It is sufficient to say that, as far as any
evidence is fumished, either by the writings of Aristotle
himself or by external testimony, as to their original
connexion; it is no more a departure from the authority
cf the Stagirite to assign a field to Logic inconi-
mensurate with that of the Organon‚ than it is to write
a moral treatise on the basis of the Ethics, without
including the Politics. Leaving then the question ot
