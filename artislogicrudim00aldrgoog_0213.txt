ΟΝ THE ENTHYMEME.

Tar Enthymeme is defined by Aristotle, συλλογισμὸς
[ἀτελὴς] ἐξ εἰκότων ἢ σημείων. The word ἀτελὴς is now

universally admitted to be spurious3 and that upon
abundantly sufficient evidence, both externa] and in-
temal⁸. Externally, it is not countenanced by the best
MSS. Internally‚ it is inconsistent with the ordinary
languagc of Aristode 3 with whom the imperfect syllogism
signifies, not a Syllogism with ane portion suppressed,
but a Syllogism in the second or third figure, which is
not immediately evident by the dictam cle amoti et atillo,
The word is an interpolation, and a clumsy one, designed
to accommodate Aristotle’s definition to subsequent views
of the nature oi the Enthymeme, and made by a scribe
not particularly well verscd in Aristotelian phraseology.

The εἰκὸς and σημεῖαις themselves are Propositionsb3 the

which is known to'be an indication, more or less certain,

memes drawn from each. The ‘aaa clearly regarded by Aristode as a
qeneral proposition, employed as a premise.v In the Rhetoric, i. 2. 15. he
describes it as having the same relation to its conclusion as an universal to
a particular. In another sense, any proposition may be called probablc,
which can ac a conclusion be supported'upon (morally) reasonable grounds ᾗ
