ch. 6. the first is properly called Divisio, the second, Partitio.
‘⁶ In partitione quasi membra sunt ; ut corporis caput, humeri,
manue, latera, crura pedes, et cetera: in divisione, formae sunt,
quas Graeci ideas vocant; nostri, si qui haec forte tractant, species
appellant.” of. Quintil. v. 10. vii 1. ln Division, the whole
or its definition can be predicated 01 each part, as “Homo est
animal,’' “Homo est vivens sensibile.'’ In Partition this can- ,
not be done. Boethius however, includes under his second
head, not only the enumeration 01 the component parts 01 an
individual, but also that 01 the individuale contained under an
infimo specics “Ut cum dico domus aliud esse tectum, aliud
paries, aliud undamentum cumque hominis dicimus partes
esse Catonem, Virgilium, Ciceronem.” The last in one respect
more resembles division proper; as the name and definition 01
the whole are predicable 01 each part. But on account 01 the
infinite number 01 individuale, and consequent impossibility
01 exhausting the species, this is not generally reckoned 00 0
division proper.

The division 01 an equivocal term, as cacis into animat,
01100, piscia is sometimes called distinction. The test 01 this
is, that the nemeis predicable 01 ecch member, but not the
same definition. This is useful for separating the senses 01
an ambiguous term before defining it. See Top. vi. 2. 1.

¹¹ For the due observancc 01 these rules, it is desirable that
the divisions consist 01 cs few members as possible. Some
recommend (1100010000, or a division 01 every genus into two
species by means 01 opposed differentiae. Of the four kinds
01 Opposition, Boethius admits ior this purpose contraries
positive and privative terms, and also contradictorios as some·
times unavoidable; but rejects relatives. Aristotle censurec
