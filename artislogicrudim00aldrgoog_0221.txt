Secondly, it may be observed that the Enthymeme is
not necessarily confined to the Rhetorica] kind of matter.
A syllogism from likelihoods or signs, whatever be the
subject, is an Enthymeme, In like manner, any syllogism
in probable matter may become an instrument of Dialectio
reasoning3 whether it be based on the general probabilities
which Dialectio materially fumishes, or on more limited
assumptions drawn from special observations. The
Physician, for example, within the field of his own
experience, may know that in nine cases out of ten
where a patient exhibits certain symptoms, the disease
terminates fatally. The student of history may learn
that in the majority of cases revolution leads to anarchy,
and anarchy is suppressed by despotism. Either of
these may become the basis of a reasoning process in
probable matter, but the Syllogism or Enthymeme is not,
properly speaking, Dialectical or Rhetorical, but Medical
or Political. And although there is nothing in the
Dialectical or Rhetorical Method that prevents its being
applied to these or any other special subjects, yet in
proportion as any one so applies it, Aristode regards him
as departing from the legitimate matter of Dialectio or
Rhetoric, and adopting that of some definite Art or
Science¹. For the same reason, when he speaks of the
special application of Rhetoric to Political deliberation,
he warns us that its object matter must not be consi-
dered as that of Rhetoric per se, but as primarily and
properly belonging to Potitios, secondarily only to
Rhetoric in one of its practioal applications”.
