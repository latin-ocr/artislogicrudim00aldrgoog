⁰ Aristotle does not recognise this account of matteras
understood in every qnare proposition, hut only as repressori in a
nwdol. (see above, p. 37.) In the latter case it is no test of
quantity, aethere are universal and particular propositione of
each mode. The distinction in the text, however, seems to
have been early introduced. Itis implied in the commentary
of Ammonius on de Int. 7. (Scholia, p. 115. a. 14.) And Psellus
defines the three kinds of matter thus: Necessory, when the
predicate isos the cesenae, or a property ; continyent when
it is an accident to the subject ; impossible, when a repugnant
quality.¹ In this he is followed by Petrus Hispanus. But this
consideration of matter is clearly extralogical. See Sir W.
Hamilton, Ed. Rev. No, 115. p. 217. The Leonico cannot
determine a proposition to be necessary or contingent, unless
statedassuch. The pointmust be ascertained from the Science
to which the proposition materially belongs. The Logician,
however, may use indefinitas as particidars, not assigning a
quantity from the matter, but admitting an indefinite premise
(and therefore conclusion) where the rules of the figure do not
require an universal. Hence the minor premise in fig. 1. may
be indefinite, but not the major. See An. Pr. i. 4. 9.
