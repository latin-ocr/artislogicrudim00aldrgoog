Conditionalis igitur Syllogismi duae sunt, nec
plures formulae.

sententia conditionaliter efferri semper potest ¹¹.

s By adopting the above modes of reduction, it may easily
be seen that the violation of this third rule is equivalent, in
the case of denying the antecedent, to an illicit process of
the major term; in that of affirming the consequent, to on

Ι undistributed middle.
⁸The destructive syllogism is naturally reduced to the ‚

second figure in the categorical form, and cannot in most
cases be brought to the first without considerable awkward-
ness. This may be avoided by concerttnp the hypotheticol
before reduction. A hypothetical proposition is converted by
Contrupositiou; thuS, “ If A is B, G is D‚” t0, “ If G is not D,
A is not B.'' The syllogism may then be treated as a con-
structive. Os. Hamilton on Reid, p. 697. Whately's Logic,

Logicians are at issue. The majority (Kant among the
number) regard it as stating all possible casce, so that one
