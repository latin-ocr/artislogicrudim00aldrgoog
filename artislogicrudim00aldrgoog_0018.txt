Aarnoucu the writings of Aristotle are the source
from which the sciense of Logic is principally derived,
it is remarkable that there is no single name sanctioned
by the Stagirite himself, under which can be compre·
' hended either the whole collection of treatises known by
the name of the Organon, or the entire subjectos which
they treat. Λογικὴ, as the name of an art or science, is
not to be found in his works3 and the cognate terms,
λογικὸς and λογικῶς, are used in a very different sense

The logical synopi-sm of Aristotle is opposed, sometimes
to the analyticol, sometimes to the plryss’cal syllogism3
and signifies a process of reasoning from general
principles of probability, as distinguished from one
ol which the principles are elicited by special contem-
plation of a given objector notion⁸. It is therefore
opposed alike to the demonstrative reasoning, in which
necessary truths are resolved into the axiomatic principles
on which they depend‚ and to that by which physical
phenomena are referred to general laws of nature.

The word διαλεκτικὴ is equally limited in its Aristotelian
sense ; though this term underwent considerable modi-
