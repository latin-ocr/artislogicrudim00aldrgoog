mits only a relative differentia. His definition of man
is ζῷον λογικὸν θνητόν; rational being the differentia of man
when compared with brutes; morrat, when compared with
the Gods ⁸. But if either of these attributes be selected as
the differentia of man absolutely, we must again have
recourse to Realism to justify the position. If species are
made by Nature, they may have been so framcd that each
has a peculiar characteristic shared by no other. How
this can be proved to be the case is another question ;
but there is no ὰ priori impossibility in the supposition.
But if the species is but a conception formed by the
mind, what is to hinder us from forming three complex
notions, abc, old, aod, of which no part is a differentia
absolutely and per se, though c distinguishes the first
from the second, and b the first from the third?
. With regard to the doctrine of the Infima Species being
the abele ess-enee of the individuals of which it is
predicated, the case is still olearon inasmuch as this
language was expressly maintained by the Realists, and
expressly repudiated by the Nominalists. Itis true that
it is previously to be found in Boethius3 but here his
authority is oi little value, as nothing can be more vacil-
lating than his opinions on the whole question. Boethius
wrote his Commentaries with the design of reconciling
Aristotle with Plato; he succeeded only in contradicting
himself. Inone of his expositions of Porphyry he goes
beyond Plato in Realism3 in the other, he is a professed ¹
Conceptualiso. But even had his views been more definite
in favour of the latter hypothesis, it would only shew that
he admitted details into his system inconsistent, if pushed
to their ultimate consequences, with its main positions.
