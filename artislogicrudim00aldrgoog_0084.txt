Nam l. sit vera E0, puto Nullum A est B: Ergo
(cum uterque terminus distribuatur) quodvis A
differt a quovis B. Ergo vicissim: Ergo Nullum
B est A. 2. Sit vera 1: Ergo falsa est ejus Con·

It should be observed‚ that the old Logicisns‚ following
Boethius, maintain, that in conversion by contraposition‚ as
wellas 111 the others, the quality should remain unchsnged.
Consequently the converse of “All A is B’' is “All not B is
not A,” and of “Some A is not B,'' “Some not B is not
not A.” It is simpler, however, to convert A into E and 0
into Ι, (“ No not B is A;” “Some not B is A,’') as is done
byWallis and Abp. Whately; and before Boethius byApuleius
and (lapella, who notice the conversim, but do not give ita
name. The principle of this conversion may be found in
Aristotle,'1'op.ii. 8. 1. though he does not employ it for
logical purposes.

θ Sit coro Β. This is the proof given by Theophrastus and
Eudemus. (Alexander, Scholia, p. 148. 11119.) Aristotle proves
it by the method called ἕκθεσις, 1. e. hythe cohibitioo of an
individual instance, (ἐκτιθέναι asponae sacrut; whence a syl-
logism with singular promises is called Syllopasmua copo
11111111.) Thus, No A is Β, therefore No B is A, for if not,
Some 1111111111 Β, say O, is A. Then O is both A and Β,
and therefore it will not he true that No A is B; which was
the original proposition. Aristotlc does not assume the con-
version of Ito prove that of Β, which would be arguing in
schole. 11011111111101111111, see Hamilton on Reid, p. 196.

Alexander himself offers a third proof by syllogism in
the first figure. No A is B, therefore No Β 11 Α; 101 suppose
“Some B is A,” and “ No A is B‚” Some B is not B.

Having proved the conversios of E, those of A and I will
follow 110111 it. ‘¹ All A is B, therefore Some Β 11 A ;” or else
No B is A, and therefore (by conversion) No A is B; whereas
we assumed All A is Β. And again, Some A is B, therefore
Some B is A; 01 else No B is A, and therefore No A is B.

For these proofs, the only assumption necessary is the
principle 01 namnidon.
