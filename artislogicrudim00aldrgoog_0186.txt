ΟΝ DEFINITION.

Iu the notes to Aldrich's account of Definiti0n‚ 1
have endeavoured to explain his language in conformity
with the views most commonly found in Logioal Trea·
tises. But as these views differ in many respecta from
those of Aristotle, on which they are supposed to be
founded, and as a correct account of the doctrines of that
Philosopher will materially assist in the solution of more
than one of those vexate questiones which are most
perplexing to beginners in Logic‚ Ι shall attempt a
somewhat fuller exposition here.

In the second Book of the Posterior Analytios, Aristotle
mentions three different forms of Definition‚ in the
following words: Ἔστιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς εἷς μὲν λόγος τοῦ τί ἐστιν
ἀναπόδεικτος, εἷς δὲ συλλογισμὸς τοῦ ri ἔστι, πτώσει διαφέρων τῆς
’ ἀποδείξεως, τρίτος δὲ τῆς τοῦ σι’ ἐστιν ἀποδείξεως συμπέμψω.
This passage is a concise summary of the whole Aristo·
telian theory of Definition. Adopting it as our text, we
prooeed to comment as follows.

A necessary preliminary to the determining the Real
Definition of any object, (σι’ ἔστι,) is to ascertain that
such object exista (ὅτι tce). Otherwise our Definition
will be merely a nominal oneb. But we have two classes
of definable objecto, of which the existence is determined
in two different wayS, producing a corresponding variety
in the form of the Definition.
