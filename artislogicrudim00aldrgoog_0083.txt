the Grammarian: we must be guided by the idiom of the
languaga we are using. ln Latin, e. g. tha substantive acquires
an adjective power, and the adjective a substantive, without
change 11 form; 1. g. “nullus sapiens 111 iracundus,'' ‘⁶ nulld's
iracundus est sapiens.” In English we must say, ⁶⁶ No angry
1111 11 wise.” Rules on this point are extralogical.

The directions 11 some logicians as to the conversion 11
past and 11111111 time, e. g. “nullus senex erit puer,” are also,
logically speaking, 111 11 place 11111, though practically helps

sentence is not, as it stands, a logical propositam and should
be reduced 11 such, before it comes into the hands 11 the
converter.

³ Aristotle's account 11 conversion differs somewhat from
this. He divides conversion into universal and particular,
, according 11 the quantity 11 the proposition after 1111111111.
Consequently Ε 11 converted univcrcaily‚ A and I particularly.
