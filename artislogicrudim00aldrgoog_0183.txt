distinct in comprehension, they may be either equal or
unequal in extension.

The two first cases will correspond to the class of
Propositions called by Kant, Analytical Judgments, and
by Mr. Mill, Verbal Propositions. In these we merely
essert that the attributes composing the Predicate are
a part or the whole of those composing the Subjeot.
They depend solely on the principle of Contradiction.
If Animal form part of the conception Man, Man is an
Animal, or we have a contradiction in terms.

To avoid the introduction of new words, we may retain
the Aristotelian nomenclatura of Genus and Definiticn to
express the relation of Predicate to Subject in these two
classes of Propositions; though the former appellaticn‚
for the reason stated above, is not altogether free from
objections. Under Definition may be also included a
class of Propositions, which are not in the strict sense of
the word Analytice10, and are not admitted by Aristotle
tc be Definitions proper 3 viz. those in which the Predicate
is a single term synonymous with the Subject.

The last two cases will correspond tc the Synthetical

‘ Judgments of Kant, and tc the Real Propositions of Mr.

Mill. In these, the Subject is neither a word nor a notion,
but the several individual things cf which a certain notion
is predicable. For example, in the Proposition, “All men
ere mortal,” we do not mean that the conception Man
includes Mortality, but that the individuals possessing
the attributes comprehended in the former notion possess
also those comprehended in the latter.

In distinguishing a certain portion of these Propositions
as predicating Property, we must divest ourselves alto·
gether of the notion of necessary or contingent con-
nexion, and regard the word purely as a translation of
the Aristotelian ἴδιον. These Propositions essert not

citly analytioal. ’ >
