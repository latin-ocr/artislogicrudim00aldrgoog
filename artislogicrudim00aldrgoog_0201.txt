These being excluded, the only office that remains for
Logic to perform, is to contributa to the distinctoees of a
conception, by an analysis and separate exposition of
the different parts contained within it. This operation
is analogous to that of drawing formal inferences, cirtuolly
contained in their premises, though not explicitly de·
veloped0. It isa process of sels-examination, not dis· ,
similar to the Platonie application of Dialectic, though
widely differing as regards the objectiva truth of its
results. For the Logioal process fumishes only a sub-
jective criterion3 it enables us to represent more distinotly
to the mind, the notione previously existing there in more
or less confusion ι, its rules directus to compare eon-
ceptions one with another, and furnish some security for
our own consistency in employing them; they do not
enable usto ascertain their accordanee with external
objectS, or to add the deficient parte, where they are
inadequate representatives of the latter. The mind, like
the shy, has its nebulae, which the telescope of Logio
may resolve into their component stars. But here the
parallel fails The Logioal instrument discovers no
luminary whose rays have not previously entered the
eye; it tells us nothing of their relative distanceS, of the
velocity with which their light travels 3 of any thing, in
short, which did not form a confused portion of the
sensuous representationl. This may seem but beggarly
service to be performed hythe Art of Arts and Science
of Sciences. Inferior certainly it is to the gigantis
