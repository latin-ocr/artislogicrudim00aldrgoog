plex notion coextensive with that of which the Definition
is sought. Of the notion thus obtained, each separate
part is more extensive than that which is 10 be defined,
though the whole is not so‘.

This method was afavourite with Plato; it was rejected
as useless by Speusippus⁸. Aristotle adopts an inter·
mediate course, limiting, however, its utility chiefly to
two points,-the right arrangement 01 the several parts
01 the Definition, and the security that nothing essentia]
is omitted. It would thus seem to he useful, not so
much for discovering Definitions as for testicy them¹¹;
and even in this respect will he applicable only to one
class 01 Definitions, that 01 Substances by genus and
differentiae.

For discovery, the second method is employed. This
is commonly called the Inductive Method; a name, how-
ever, 101 sanctioned by Aristotle 1111100111. It consists in
examining the several individuals of which the term to
be defined is predicable, and observing what they have
in common. 11 we ean obtain one common notion, that

‘Anah Post. ii. 13. 3. Τὰ δὴ τοιαῦτα ληπτέον μέχρι τούτου, ἕως τοσαῦτα
ληφθῇ πρῶτον, ὧν ἕκαστον μὲν ἐπὶ πλεῖον ὑπάρξει, ἅπαντα δὲ μὴ ἐπὶ πλέον·
ταύτην γὰρ ἀνάγκη οὐσίαν εἶναι τοῦπράγματος. Yet in the Metaphysies
(vi. 12.) he seems 10 maintain that the last differentia must be coex-
10111νο with the subject; a view generally adopted hythe Scholastio
Logicians, though manifestly inconsistent, not only with the passage above
' quoted, but with 1110010111Ιο011101101111δὲπελευταΐονκαὶπῇδυάδι. 11
the Metaphysics however he seems 10 be speaking, not 01 the specific
difference per se, but 01 the difference regarded cs dividing the genus.
But this is in fact equivalent only 10 saying that 1110111010 must be oo·
extensive; which no one would think 01 denying.

¹¹ This is perhaps marked by Aristotle¹s own language. In reference 10
the one method, he uses κατασκευάζειν; 10 the other, ζητεῖν.

¹ Aristode does 101 give any name to the process; hy his Commentators
it has beon variously denominated the method 01 Resolution, 01 Com-
position, of Induction. Cf. Ed. 1101110111. paco. Ζο11010110, Logia,
