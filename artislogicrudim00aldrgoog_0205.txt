and Bis greater than C, therefore a fortiori Α is greater
than G.” The logical form is,

Whatever is greater than 'a greater than C is greater than 0;
A is greater than a greater than Ο,
Therefore A is greater than 0.

Or if it be required that the a fortiori nature of the
reasoning appear in the conclusion, we must state the
major, “Whatever is greater than a greater than 0 is
greater than 0 by a greater amacura?

of the same kind is the reasoning, “A is equal to B,
therefore twice A is equal to twice B.'’ The logical

form ia,

The doubles of equal things are equal;
Twice A and twice B are doubles of equal things
Therefore they are equal.

The major premise might be stated more generally,

“ Equimultiples of equal things are equal.”
