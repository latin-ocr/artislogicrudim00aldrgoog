are all qualitiea of the Proposition. But the distinction is
¹ useful as a mnemonic. Kant distinguishes them as Belerion,
ἵ Quality, and Quantity.

³¹ This, and the greater part of the scholastic memorial
verses, are found for, the first time in the Sarnmalce Loqicalea
¹ of Peter of Spain, afterwards Pope John XXI. who died in
Α 1277. He does not, however, profess to be the author of
them ;Ι indeed some, including the present, are also notieed
by his contemporary Aquinas, as established mnemonics. In
slight measure he has been anticipated hythe Greeks. A

’ « mnemonic for the opposition of modals is found in the synopsis

of Psellus, and one for the syllogistic moods in Nicephorus
Blemmidaa

. ¹¹ This is argued at some length in athesis appended to
Wallis's Logic; and is, to say the least, by far the most con-
venient way of bringing singular propositione under the
exi'sting rules of the syllogism. At the same time it may be
remarked that the employment of singular terms as predicates
ia unnatural, and the reasoning, at least in affirmative syl·
‚logisma worthless See An. Pr. i. 27. 3. Indeed it may be
questioned whether the ἕκθεσις of Aristotle (see below p. 51.)
was regarded by him as a syllogism at all. Of. Aquinas,
