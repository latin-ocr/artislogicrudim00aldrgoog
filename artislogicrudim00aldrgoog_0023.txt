As regards 'the definitions of Socrates, they may be
illustrated by the distinction which we find him drawing
between declaring the essence of thing, and declaring its
qualities3 between determining what a thing is in itself, ·
and what attributes it possesses. Thus, in the Gorgias,
Polus being asked what art Gorgias professes, replies‚
“the best of all arts.'' On which Socrates remarks, ἀλλ’
οὐδεὶς igeret, ποία τις εἴη ἡ Γοργίου τέχνη, ἀλλὰ τίςο. Thus far,
by constantly insisting on the distinction between essential
and non-essential predication, Socrates may be regarded
as having furnished the germ of the theory of definition
developed by Aristotle. Except in this respect, we cannot

regard Socrates as having contributed to the ccience of .

Logia. Whatever may be the importanoe of his method
of induction in the ort of persuasion, it has no place
in a scientific analysis of the mental operatione.

In Plato, Dialectio assumes a higher position. Though
still retaining its primary sense, as the art of com-
municating, or rather eliciting‚ knowledge colloquially, it
is connected with a peculiar object matter, and that the
highest. It is the science of the eternal and immutable,
which is cognisant of the essenoe of things, of Being in
general and its attributes ; and thus it has insight into those
universal principles upon which all other knowledge is
dependent. Thus considered, the Dialectic of Plato,
though differing in form, is in object identical with the
First Philosophy or Metaphysics of Aristotle. Socrates
had previously represented his art as an intellectual ψ
midwifery, useinl in delivering the pregnant soul, but of
no service tc the barren oner. But Socrates, if we may
trust the positive testimony of Aristotle, had not recourse
to a separate world of ideas, to find a divine father for
the children at whose birth he assisteda But in Plato's
