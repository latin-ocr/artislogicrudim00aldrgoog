‘¹ The Soritcs is a series of propositions in which the pre-
dicate of each is the subject of the next; the conclusion being
formed of the first subject and the last predicate. It may be
expanded into a series of syllogisms in the first figure, the
conclusion of each being the minor promise of the next.
There will be as many syllogisms as there are intermediate
propositions between the first premise and the conclusion;
the first being the only minor promise stated. Hence there

can only be one particular premise in a SoriteS, the first; the
others being major premises in the first figure. And the last
is the only promise which may be negative: for any previous
negative promise would produce a negative conclusion, which
could not be used as a minor promise in the next syllogism.

The Sorites is not recognised as a distinct kind of reason-
ing by Ari stotle. Nor is there any reason why it should have
been; as it is merely a combinationes ordinary syllogisms‚
succinctly expressed. Its distinct exposition is attributed to
the Stolos. But the principle, as Melancthon observes, is
implied 'm Categ. 3. 1. and the Sorites itself is alluded to in
Anal. Pr. i. 25. 2, 11. The Sorites must not be confounded
with the well-known fallacy of the same name, attributed to
Eubulides of Miletus. In fact, the term has been loosely
applied to various kinds of reasoning.
