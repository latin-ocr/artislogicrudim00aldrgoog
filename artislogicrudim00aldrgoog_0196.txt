that which is incapable of definition, aud which in
consequence necessarily involves its own failure. The
same may be said of the principal opinion which
Aristotle controverts Whether we regard Pleasure with
Plato, as consisting in a motion towards our natural state
of harmony, or with Aristotle, in the perfectiori of our
energies3 neither of these can be termed an explanation
of the feeling itself, but only of the cause by which it 10
produced. Pleasure 110011 1011101110 011 indefinite some·
thing, consequent on theone or the other. Yet examined
according to Aristotle's own view of the definition of
Attributes, we see that pleasure is as fairly defined by
the perfection of the energy, as an eclipse by the inter·
ception of light:

There are, however, conditione and limita to the

definitions of attributes, though they are nottho same
³ as those ofSubstances. Every Substanceto be definable
must be 0 Species. Every Attribute must be a Property,
i. e. must be capable of demonstration by its cause.
Accidents then, as merely contingent attributes 010
incapable of defiuition. This limitation‚ however, is
merely relative to the degree of our knowledge of the
matter. The advance of Scienoe may transform Acci-
dents into Properties, and thus fumish the requisita
means of definition.

Before concluding the subject, it will be necessary to
say 0 few words on two other points connected with
Aristotle’s doctrine of Definition.

The first of these is his method of investigatiug, or, as

affected in two ways commonly called the methods of
Division and Induction. The first of these consiste
in taking a wide (1011110, 11111101 which the object to be
defined is evidently included, and contracting it by the
addition of successive differentiae, till we obtain a eom-
