struck from thc same die. ln the latter sense, the
attributes forming the humanity of Socrates are not the
same with those forming thc humanity of Plato; though
the common notion man embraces both, and though by
availing ourselves of an ambiguity of languagc, we say
that both are of tte same species.

General notioris thus framed by the mind, when
expressed in language‚ form common terms. And the
various attributes comprehendedk in every such notiori are
its essenoe1. By this we do not mean any thing necessary
to the physical existence of an object; but merely that,
as general notioris are formed from the observation of
similar attributes in individuale, every individual must
possess such attributeS‚ if it is to be included under the
extension of the notion and called by the corresponding
common name. Proper names, on the contrary, have no
essence, as they have no general notionbelonging to
them, but are mere arbitrary marks imposed for the

purpose of distinguishing individuals from each other.
But though our earliest complex notioris may have
becn gained from real objecta, there is uo reason why

k In a Pamphlet published under the name of “A Dissertation on the
Heads of Prcdicables,” Iinadvertcntly adopted Mr. Mill's expressions of
conectattou and denotatioa, to distinguish between the attributes contained
in a complex notion, and the subjecta of which it is predicated. The
distinction I still regard as most important, and one that is not perhaps
sufficiently marked in modern languagc; but further study ol the scholastic
phraseology hes led me to regard Mr. Mill's language as too wide a
departure from the original use of the terma For this reason I have
preferred the expressions Omprelveastoa and Recessim, as better sanc-
tioned by Logical authority. Cf. Port Royal Logic, P. 1. chap. 6. “ J‘appellc
comprehensim de lidae, les attributa quelle enferme en soi. J’appella
§tendas de l’idee, les sujcts 1 qui cette ideo convient.” For the Scholastie
connotation, see p. 13, note f.

¹ This is the Nomtuol Essence of Locke, which corresponds tc the
Logical Essence of other philosophare, though variously explained according
to their different Metaphysical theorias. The term Recl Essence is used
hythe same philosopher to denote that generally unknown constitution of
things on which their sensible properties depend.
