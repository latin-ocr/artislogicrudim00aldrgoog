The collection of the whole into one volume is probably
not of earlier date than the time cf Andronicus of Rhodcs3
and even after that time, the commentatore differed in
opinion as to the genuineness and order of the several
partsd. Both external and internal evidence lead to the
same conclusion, that Aristotlc did not compose the
Organon as a whole, or recognise one Art cr Scicnce of
Logic as the subject of it.

The Greek commentators upon Aristotle are our
earliest extant authority for the use of the word Logic
in its modern sense. Alexander of Aphrodisias, the
oldest of those whose works have come down to us,
speaks of ἡ asyla& nal συλλογιστικὴ πραγματεία as con-
taining under it ἀποδεικτικῆ, διαλεκτική, ueremini, and

signification, Logic is extended so as to include the
syllogistic theory in general, and its particular applica-

tha citatione are rcciprocal, and, if genuine, imply a revised edition 01 one
or the other. M. St. Hilaire lays 100 much strcss on the assertion cf
Galen, as 10 the origin of the titles 01 the Prior and Posterior Analytics.
He leaves us in this dilemma. Either all the references to the above

in every instance, changed the titles. Of. 81. Hilaire, Memoire, vol. i. p. 42.
