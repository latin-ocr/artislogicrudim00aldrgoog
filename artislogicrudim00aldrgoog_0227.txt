this point it will be sufficient to observo, that any attempt
to reduce induction to Syllogism, in the strict sense of the
term, must commence by inverting the whole operatium
stating as a preliminary assumption that which is really
the conclusion of the Inductive process. It moreover
leaves us no alternative between converting mere em·
pirical judgments into sels-evident axioma, or destroying
the whole foundation cf reasoning‚ by commencing with
a Syllogism whose promises themselves must be proved
by another Syllogism‚ aud so on od infinitum..

The Aristotelian Induction proper bas been described
asan analytica, its counterpart, Syllogism, as a spn-
ueneat, process3 and the tvvo have respectively been
identified with the λόγοι ε’πῖ τᾶς ἀςχάς and ant τῶν ἀρχῶν
cfA1·istotle³. And this is in one sense correct, though,
according to a various notiori of whole and part, the
terms Analysis and Synthesis have perpetually been
interchanged with each other. According as we loolr to
the comprehensiva, orto the extensius of the potions, we
may regard the Genus as apert of the Species or the
Species as spart of the Genus. Hence the notions of
Synthesis and Analysis, of the composition of· parts into
anhole, and the resolution of a whole into, parte, will,
as we adopt the oue or the other point ol· vien, be
inverted. We have previously spoken of Induction as
an inference from the constituting parts to the constituted
whole· In this respect it is syntheticol. To regat-tl it as
analyticcl, we. must adopt the metaphorica}¹ relation οἷ’
part and whole as simpler or more complex notions. In
this point of view, Division and Definition are respect
tively the Synthesis and Analysis of notio-ns, os expressere
in simple term-c. In the fonner, we combine Genus and
Differentia into Species3 in the latter, vve resolve Species
