quae dicuntur (Apuleius ‘formulas’ vocat), ab Aristotele ap·
pellatas esse Jul. Pacius putat, quia figuris geometricis ad-

scriptis syllogismi ab eo illustrati sint. Equidem hanc vocem -

non tam a geometricis petitam quam de ipso ordine ter-
minorum accipiendam putaverim, quem σχῆμα appellari licebit,
etiam si de geometricis figuris non cogitetur: sic enim supra

Pr. i. 8.) 10 Galen. The latter may possibly have first
called the five moods by that name, but they were known at
a much earlier period as indirect moods 01 the first figure.
An indirect mood is one in which we do not infer the im-
mediate conclusion, but its converse. Consequently, the
predicate 01 the conclusion, which in a direct mood is the
major term, is in an indirect one 1110111101. The five indirect
moods 01 the first figure were called, Baralip‚ (1011111100, Dabitis,

to the two last, the process is alittle more intricate. They have
