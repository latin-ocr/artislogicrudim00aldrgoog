reasoning. It is a Dialectie Syllogism, if employed for
the purpose of dialectis disputati0n3 and, as it usually'
relates to those subjecta to which dialectis disputetion is
practically applicor, it may in general be regarded as
potentially‚ at least, dialectic⁸⁶

In fact, it is not as an Enthymeme, but as a lelorical
Syllopiam, that a given specimen of reasoning is dis-
tinguished from the Dialectical. The object of the two
arts is distinct. That of Dialectie is to convince the
Intellect3 that of Rhetoric‚ to persuade the Will. The
same instrument may be employed by both, auditis
merely the purpose for which it is employed that con-
stitutos the distinction between themh. Whether the
same means arc always available for both purposes;
whether the same informality of reasoning is allowed in
Dialectic as in Rhetoric‚ must depend on the conditionsby
which the disputante in the former choose to hind them-
selves. The Rhetorician has to influence an audienoe: if
he ean effect thiahe will not always be scrupulous about

s This, however‚is by no means necessary. Matters not usually discussed
either by the Dialectician or Orator may equally be proved by means of
τεκμήρια. For example; the falling of tbe thermometer to 32⁰ is a slya of
freezing; the obscuration ol the moon in eclipse is a siqu that the earth’s
shadow is interposcd between it and the sun. Such subjecta are not
practically dialectical‚ at least in Aristotle’s view of the art. Assar as the
mere interrogatory torm is concamed, it may bc, and was by different
Philosophers, applied to all varieties of matter.

s This proceeds on the supposition that the Dialectician is bound to
logical aceuracy in his reasonings3 a restrictiori which Aristotle at
least would regard aa salutary. See Anal. Post. i.6.10. We need not
however suppose that all disputante actually eonfonned to it.
