Is THE SYLLOGISM 'a PETITIO Pnlrvclrui

ΤΗΕ eagle of the Libyen feble was killed by en arrow
feethered from his own wing. The armoury of the
Logicien hes been fondly imagiued to contain the fatal
weapon of his own destructi-on. But the champion
destined to wield it, if such there be, is somewhat tardy
iu his forthcoming. More than one Sir Kay has esseyed
the adventure of the sword3 the Arthur destined to
achieve it remeius in all the mysterious diguity of e
Oomiug Man. In other words, many writers heve sues
oeeded in showing their own ignorance of the natum of
Ι the fellacy called Potitio Prinoipii; they heve not been
equally successful in proviug the invalidity 01 the ’
Syllogistic process.

Let us first endeavour 10 ascertaiu what the Potitio

Principii really ie. The name is a blundering traus- .

letion 01 the Aristotelian ri ἐν ἀρχῇ (01 τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς)
dissiciat: i. e. the assumption, not 01 the principle properly
so ealled⁸, but, in some form 01 other, 01 the question
originally proposed 101 proof. And it is remarkable, that
among the five modes 01 this fallecy enumereted by
Aristode, one isin form not distinguishable from the
legitimate Syllogisml. Selectiug this variety, as that by
which most 01 all-the objection is 10 be sustained, wc
will proceed to examine its peculiarities

⁸ ‘¹ Without catering on the various meanings 01 the term Principis, ·

which An'atotle defines, in generabitur srom 101101 any 11109 eride, is
produced, oria 11001011, itis sufficient tc say, that it is always used 101 that
on which something else depende; and thus both sor an original 1010, and
for an original eumenid Sir W. Hamiltnn, Reid’s Worlm, p. 761.

ἀξιώσειε μίαν εἶναι.
