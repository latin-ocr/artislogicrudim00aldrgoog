ing 01 all formal reasoning. All reasoning, he tells us,
is really from particulars 10 particulars. But in that
case, all inference must depend upon the matter, and
cannot be reduced to any general type. 11, 101 example,
Ι conclude that the Dulce 01 Wellington is mortal, solely
from the premiseS, “ John, Thomas, &c are mortal, and
the Duke 01 Wellington resembles these in certain other
attributes;'' Ι might, by an argument 01 precisely the same
form, prove him to be a Frenchman, because he possesses
the attributes 01 humanity in common with certain given
individuals of that nation.

This portion 01 the question resolves itself into the
following. What do we mean when we essert that all
“ men are mortal? Is it merely a concise mode 01 stating
that Socrates and Plato possess this attribute, in
common with a number 01 other individuals, quos uuae
perscribere lorcyum est? Ι1 so, to argue, “Socrates is one
01 the individuals above mentioned, therefore he 10
’ mortal,'’ is, 11 001016991119 01 the question, at least a
needless repetition 01 a previous statement.

But, 1111001, the Universa] proposition means no such
thing. lt means that, by virtue 01 a certain established
law, certain attributes or groups of attributes, are always
00 united, that in whatever individuals we find the one,
we may look upon them as an infallible mark 011110

00 11 need not presuppose a complete enumeration 01
them‘.
