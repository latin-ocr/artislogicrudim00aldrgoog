by this or that name is comparatively unimportant3 but
it is not so when, commencing with a clear conception of
the one or the other, we endeavour to develope the
whole subject in conformity to the leading notion. In
proportion as we regard Logic as a means of operation
rather than as an inquiry into truth, in the same pro-
portion are we in danger of overloading our system with
foreign embellishments, and sacrificing its scientific
unity to a spurious Utilitarianism¹. That the Sciences
are capable of practical applications, no one pretends to
deny; but because Astronomy is serviceable in Navigation,
and Chemistry in Agriculture, is the exponent of the
Science warranted in making these accidental circum-
stances the leading featmes of his exposition? The past
history of Logic fumishes ample evidence of the effects
of such a treatment. To this cause it is principally
owing, that its professors have been so often charged
with promising what they cannot perform, or what can
be as well performed without them3 that they have
been taunted with examples of Reasoners who are no
Logicians, and Logicians who are no Reasoners. To
this may'be mainly attributed the misapprehension that
to this day exists as to the character and relative merits
of the writings of Aristotle and Bucon. By this Logicians
have principally been influenced, when they have dressed
up their system in a motley of the horrowed plumes of
other branches of knowledge, to entrap unwary readerS,
and increase, forsooth, the general usefulness of their
doctrine¹.

¹ On this subject Ι cannot resist quoting the excellent remark cf
M. st. Hilaire. ‘⁴ Sans la legique, l'esprit de l'homme peut admirable-
ment agir, admirablement raiscnner ; mais sans elle,il ne se contrait pas
tout entierz il ignore l'rme de ses parties les plus belles et les plus
secordes La legique la lui fait connaltre. Voila son utilite: elle ne peut

pas en avoir cauere? Presace, p. 42.
