Itis not intended to deny the usefulness of Logic; but
it may safely be asserted that its more valuable fruita are
to be found in the training which the mind unconsciously
receives, than in the consciens employment of knowledge
in the formation and examination of reascnings‚ and
that both, in respect of the true character of the Scienoe‚
are secondary and accidental results, not primary and
essentia] features.

But granting Logic to be a Science, an opinion to which
internal consideratione, as well as the weight of authority,
incline usn, what is the object of its investigationi On this
subject some discrepancymaybefoundamongthoseagreed
as to the Genus. Among the Schoolmen, for example, who
generally adopted the scientifio view, Albertus Magnus?
maintained Logic to be the Science of Argumentation,
a decision for which he olaims the support of the
Arabian Philosophers, Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Algazelss.
According to this view,.Reasoning, the third of the mental
operations, is the principa] objectos Logical investigation,
the other operations secundarily, and so far as they are
subservierit to this. Aquinas adopted a modification of
this opinion, and maintained the object of Logio to be
the three operatione of the mind, so far at least as they
are dirigible by laws⁰; while Scotus combats both these
positione, and asscrts that the primary and proper object
of Logio is the Syllogismr.

celle ci, et qui la fait lire avec un peu moins de chagrin qu'on ne fnit les
autres.” Second Discours In the same spirit Dugald Stewart praises
Remus for his attacks upon Aristotle’s abcdarius demonstratione of the

syllogistic mles: with which may be profitably compared Sir W. Hamilton's ’

note, Reid’s Works, p. 698.
