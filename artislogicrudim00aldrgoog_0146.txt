⁸ The examinationi of Fallacies is extra-logical, except when
the consequence is formnlly invalid; 'in which case it moy be
detected by the ordinmy rules of syllogism. The following
Sophisms are not ull susceptible of this solution. Some ere
material fallacieS, nrising from ambiguity of langnage or
fulsity os esseition. But they are not treated of by Aristotle
’ as belonging to the Science of Logic, but to the Art of
Dialectic, os which, as hes been before observed, a con-
siderable portion is material. In fect, Aristotle's Treetise
περὶ σοφιστικῶν ἐλέγχων is merely en account of the pseudo-
refutotions principally in use among the Sophiste of his day,
whether depending upon equivocel languoge, false assumption,
or illogical reasoning.
