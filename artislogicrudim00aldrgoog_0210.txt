against such, no defence of any source of human lmow·

With regard to the syllogism of prod, we may examine
the question a little more closely. The Petitio Principii
is a material, not a ferruci fallacy, and consiste in
assuming, in demonstration‚ a non-axiomatis principle
as axiomatis, or in dialectic disputation, a non-probable
principle as probableh. It does not effect the form of

the reasoning3 but depends on the selection of premises,
when the syllogism is employed for the particular
purpose of praefi demonstrative or dialectic. These
are guilty of it who do not adopt such premises as the
laws pl the twa processes rgquire; in the one case,
propositions axiomatic or deducihle from axioms; in the
other, probable statements, sanctioned by the general
opinion of mankind or the authority of eminent persons,

ln reading Aristotle's account of this fallncy, it is
Ι evidentthat the whole point of the matter lies in the word
αἰτεῖσθαι, or λαμβάνειν 3 and that the question to be asked
is, not whether the premises virtually contain the con-
olusion‘, but whether such premises can properly be said

¹² See Anal. Pr. ii. 16. Top. viii.13.

¹ One class of reasonings are perhaps fairly chargeable with the fallacy.
Iallude to what are commonly called the proper sylloptnns of the Ramists,
which have two Singular Premises. In the first figure, it is cudent that
the conclusionis not one out of many inferences contained in the major
premise, but the very same proposition stated in different language. The
third figure is open to the same objecticn, but it may be allowed as an
ἔκθεσις or expository instance—a process not rechoned by Aristotlc as
syllogistic. Proper syllogisms in the second figure are valid, and frequently
serviceable3 but when reduced to the first, (which Aristotle regards as a
necessary test of validity‚) the negative premise must be converted from
singular to universal.

Nevertheless, as the Petitio Principii is amatarial, not a logical, fallacy,
this does not furnish grounds for objecting to the convenient arrangement
by which singular propositions are considered as in syllogism equivalent
to universals. They may be regarded, in common with other cases of the
same sallacy, as reasonings velia in form, but unsound from material
circumstances.
