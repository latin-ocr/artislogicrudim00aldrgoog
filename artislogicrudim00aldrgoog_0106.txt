distinct axioma for the second and third figures. This has

· negatively) of every member 01 0 class any subject, of which it
Ι00000100 so predicated, does not belong to the class.

Principles of third figure. I. Dictum dc Exemplo. ,

11 0 certain attribute can be affirmed of any portion of the
members of a class, it is not incompatible with tho distinctiva
attributes of that class.

II. Dictum de Excepto. If a certain attributo carr be denied 01

from the distinctiva attributes 01 that class.

Tho natural use of the second figure, according to Lambert,
is 101 the discovery arrd proof of the differences of things: that
of the third, for the discovery and proof 01 examples aud
exceptions,

Conceming Lambert's imaginary principle 01 the fourth

figure, see p. 80, note m.
