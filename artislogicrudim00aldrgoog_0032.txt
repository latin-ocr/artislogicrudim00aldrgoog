Archbishop's position can be considered in any sense
tenable. If any process of reasoning can be carried
on in the mind without the employment of language,
assuredly the laws of such process are, equally with any

other, matters of Logical investigation. Is such process ² ’

is not possible, we may then allow that Logie, primarily
concemed with the laws of Thought, is recondarily but
necessarily conversant about language as the instrument
of Thoughtr. On the metaphysical question, however,
the opinions of Philosophers are somewhat undecided.
Though the extreme theory of Condillac as to the absolute
necessity of language is generally abandoned, it is by no
means easy to decide how far it may be dispensed with.
The words of Aristotle, which have been quoted in op-
position to the Archbishop’s view, are not decisive 3 as
he is only contrasting oral with mental reasuning, with·
out determining what may be necessary for the carrying
on of the latter⁸¹ Locke distinguishes between “ Mental
PropositionS, wherein the ideas, incur understandings, are
without the use of words, put together or separated by
the mind, perceiving or judging of their agreement or
disagreement,'’ and “ Verbal Propositions, which are
words, the signs of our ideas put together or separated
in affirmative or negative sentences.'' But attho same
time, with regard to the most important class of Logical
’ Propositions, Universals, he allows that they “ can never
well be made known, and are very seldom apprehended, ¹
but as conceived and expressed in words².” In the well·

¹ Thus Sanderson, with reference however to cml, not tc mental,
language. ⁴‘ Objectum Logicae panario est, Meos humana; unde et
Logicae nomen, velut ἀπὸ τοῦλόγου, id est, ratione: secundario etiam et
oracta quaa etipsa λόγος dicta est, qua sc. sensa mentis nostroe loquendo
exprimimus.”
