the cause of the conclusion, is not the first cause, (in
which case the syllogism is not ἐξ daleam) or if the
premise be an effect and not a cause of the conclusion,
or if the premise, though immediate, be a remote and
not a proxim'ate cause of the conclusion-under these
circumstances there is no Demonstration, in the proper
sense of the term, as we only know the fact, but not the
causes.

From the above data, the scholastic successore of
Aristrnle haye coirshucted the following specimen of
demonstratio potissima.

Olane animal rationalem risibile,¹
Ornnis homo eet animal rationale: ergo
Orionis horna est risibilis.

ln this syllogism all three propositione are per ser
the major premisc and the conclusion in the second
manner3 for the subject bama, and consequently animal

risibile: the minor premise is per se in the first mannen

loma.

In all the propositions of this Demonstration, the
predicate and subject are coextensive, and the pro·

sit per ceresam aaa primam, would not alone ba regarded by Aristotle ns a

⁸ Demonstration‚ though it may form a subordinate portion of a complex

Demonstration. The ambiguity of the word Εμεσος, which has partly led
to the discrepancies on this point, hasbeen explained already.

‘See Anal. Post. i. 13. Tha distinction between mamito propter
qaid palariam and non potissima cannot fairly be attributed to Aristotle.
Tha whole of the chapters of the first book of the Posterior Analytics, from
tha first to the thirteemh inclusive, treat of one kind of Demonstration only.
The passages in the neoadbook,(ch.17 and 18.) which seem to favour tha
distinction, are hasting only of the inferior sensa of Demonstratiou, in
which it is applicable to cistarciensis ἐπὶ el πολύ. cf. Anal. Pr. i. 13.
