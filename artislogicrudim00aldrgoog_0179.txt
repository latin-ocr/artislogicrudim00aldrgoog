lowest species: to this are added certain occidental
modifications which form Socrates, and at the same time
others which form Plato. These modifications excepted,
there is nothing in Socrates which is not at the same
time in Plato, nor in Plato, which is not at the same time
in Socrates. Moreover, from these Universal Substences,
or rather from the distinetive portion of each, certain
qualities floro, or are produced as effect from cause.
Others, not connected by causation, are found in the
individuals of this or that Species, some universally in
all, others partially, in some individuals only.

From a series of assumptions of this kind, the expo-
sition of the Realist doctrine of Predicables is easy. And
this, or some other of the various pheses of Scholastie
Realism, must of necessity be assumed, if our intention
is to explain an old theory, not to construet a new one.

On the other hand, we have the modern Logician
expounding somewhat in the following style. Genera
and Species have no existence a purte Rei, but are
notions formed by the mind from observing certain points
of similarity in different individuals. But similarity
must not be confounded with identity. The image and
superscription on two coins may present no discernible
marks of distinction from each other; hut if on that
account we say that they are tle-e same, we employ the
word in an equivocal sense, which must be oarefully

Ι distinguished from that in which we say that both are

expositione of Realism might be given,
