queri potest. Puta, m· formosam duxero, mom

Dilemma nihil aliud est, quam Inductio Nepo-
troam in qua syllogismi Major conditionalis est

¹³ This remark is taken from Wallis, and is only applicable
to the Dilemma in his sense of the. term. The negative
induction appears in this form:

Neither A, nor B, nor O, is allowable;
But these are all cases of this kind;
No case is allowablc.

This, however, is clearly aperversion of the Dilemma. The
conclusion, e. g. Nullo mcor ost doomdo, does not follow
from the premises of the Dilemma of Bias ; but requires the
additional assumption, that neither matrimonial nuisance is,
under any circumstances, to be endured.

The Complex Dilemma‚ as given above, may be reduced,
if required, to a se1icsofhyp0thetical syllogisms, and so to
categoricals; thus:

Constructive. Destructive.
IfEisF,GisH; IfEisF‚GisH;
IfAisnotB,EisF; IfOisD‚Gisn0tH;

If A is not B, G is H. Iso is D, Ε is not F.

IfOisnotD,AisnotB; IfAisB,GisD;
If Ο is not D, G is H. If A is B, E is not F.

The reduction of the simple Dilemma is obvious enough.
But all such reductione, except as serving to vindicate the

universality of the syllogistic model, ere rather curicus than
useful, ⁴
